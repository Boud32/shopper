    "reasoning_trace": "The customer is looking for 'Gaming Mice'. I first filtered out accessories (mouse feet, carrying cases) and products where a mouse was secondary (tablet combo). Then, I evaluated the remaining mice based on features relevant to gaming: high DPI, programmable buttons, explicit 'gaming' descriptions, ergonomic design for long sessions, and polling rate. \n\n1.  **prod_gaming_mice_086 (Corsair M65 PRO RGB)**: This was the clear top choice. It's explicitly described as a 'competition-grade FPS gaming mouse' with a '12000 DPI high-accuracy sensor,' '8 programmable buttons,' and an 'advanced weight tuning system.' It's built for serious gaming.\n2.  **prod_gaming_mice_098 (MageGee Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo)**: While a combo, the mouse itself has significant gaming features, including up to '3200 DPI,' 'RGB LED breathing backlit,' and 'Advanced gaming optical sensor ensures accurate positioning.' It offers a good wired gaming mouse option.\n3.  **prod_gaming_mice_053 (cimetech Rechargeable Cordless Mouse)**: This mouse offers strong wireless gaming specifications for its price point, with '5 adjustable DPI 2400/2000/1600/1200/800' and a 'high polling rate 125(default)/250 Hz,' indicating better responsiveness and precision than typical office mice.\n4.  **prod_gaming_mice_124 (RAPIQUE Bluetooth Wireless Mouse)**: This product explicitly states it's 'ideal for both work and gaming' and features '6 buttons including 2 buttons for forward and backward' (useful for gaming), '3 Adjustable DPI Settings' (up to 1600), and an 'Ergonomic design.' Its versatility makes it a strong contender for a multi-purpose gaming mouse.\n5.  **prod_gaming_mice_054 (Wireless Mouse, Led Mouse Portable Mobile Optical)**: Selected as a budget-friendly wireless option. It features '7 Colorful Breathing Light Effect' (a common gaming aesthetic) and explicitly states it 'can be used as a gaming mouse,' offering up to '1600 DPI.' It's a basic entry into gaming mice with visual appeal.\n\nI excluded other products like 'prod_gaming_mice_010' and 'prod_gaming_mice_171' due to reviews indicating poor ergonomics or performance not suited for actual gaming, despite having 'LED lights.' Many other options were primarily standard office or productivity mice. The final choice, 'prod_gaming_mice_086,' offers the best overall gaming performance and features for a customer specifically seeking a 'Gaming Mouse.'"
