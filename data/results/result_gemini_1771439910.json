    "reasoning_trace": "The customer is looking for 'Mechanical Keyboards'. I first filtered the product feed to identify only actual mechanical keyboards, excluding accessories like keycaps, switches, stabilizers, KVM switches, and keyboard kits that require assembly. This resulted in a consideration set of 5 suitable products:\n\n1.  **prod_mechanical_keyboards_009 (GAMDIAS Hermes E2)**: A budget-friendly, 87-key gaming mechanical keyboard with blue (clicky) switches and 7-color backlighting. Good for general typing and gaming on a budget.\n2.  **prod_mechanical_keyboards_021 (ikbc W200)**: A wireless, 87-key mechanical keyboard featuring durable Cherry MX Red (linear) switches and PBT keycaps. Offers a good balance of features for general use, prioritizing wireless convenience and switch quality.\n3.  **prod_mechanical_keyboards_053 (Doohoeek Retro Typewriter Keyboard)**: A unique, aesthetically driven keyboard with a retro typewriter design, multi-device Bluetooth/wired connectivity, and white backlighting. Appeals to those prioritizing aesthetics and a tactile typing experience.\n4.  **prod_mechanical_keyboards_194 (KINESIS USB-A Freestyle Pro)**: An advanced ergonomic split mechanical keyboard with quiet Cherry MX Silent Red (linear) switches and full programmability. Ideal for users seeking ergonomic benefits and a quieter typing experience.\n5.  **prod_mechanical_keyboards_026 (Azio Retro Classic Bluetooth)**: A luxury vintage-style wireless/wired mechanical keyboard with genuine wood/leather accents, backlit keys, and a matching mouse. Suited for users who prioritize premium aesthetics and a complete desk setup.\n\nFor the final choice, without specific customer preferences (e.g., budget, size, switch type, use case), I selected **prod_mechanical_keyboards_021 (ikbc W200)**. This product offers a well-rounded set of features for a general mechanical keyboard user: reliable Cherry MX Red switches (linear, suitable for both typing and gaming), wireless connectivity (a popular feature), durable PBT keycaps, and a common tenkeyless (87-key) layout. While it lacks backlighting, its overall quality, convenience, and reasonable price point make it a strong, balanced recommendation for someone simply looking for a mechanical keyboard."
