Usually I can wear headphones made for kids but not these.  These are definitely for smaller heads and small ears since the ear cups get painful after a while since they aren't big enough to fully cover my ears.  The sound is o.k., nothing to write home about, but for the price (as of this review these head phones cost $19.44) I think they are worth it.

In comparison, I have about 5 different pair of dual driver in ears. These are by far my favorite.<br /><br />Live music:<br />I use more expensive 5-8 driver in ears for playing live. I will say these don\u2019t stack up against the more expensive in-ears but if I had to choose from this price bracket then I would choose these.<br /><br />Great for TV:<br />Recently I tried all my in-ears(12 pair) for listening to tv. My parents often do this as they are hard of hearing and they get a much better listening experience with headphones. Therefore, I thought I would find the most well rounded pair for doing just that. These won! I preferred them, even over headphones that cost twice as much.<br /><br />Listening to music:<br />These got the job done. I wasn\u2019t amazed but they didn\u2019t leave a lot to be desired either.<br /><br />EQ:<br />Slightly elevated lows and highs. To me they weren\u2019t harsh. They lacked some clarity but nothing sounded intrusive to my ears which tends to happen with other brands.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice packaging<br />-Quality case<br />-Somewhat a jack of all trades. Do many things well.<br />-Look stylish<br />-Fit my ears well<br />-Comfortable especially with replacement memory foam tips<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Silicone tips suck.

The dynamic driver 10mm produces some intense bass and deep lows that sound stunning and the balanced armature mixes almost perfectly together. Vocals are pushed forward a bit and mids are also. Kind of hard to explain I haven\u2019t listened that much yet but compared to my Jade Audio EA3 they aren\u2019t as professional sounding it\u2019s more of a enhanced sloppy bass and everything is pushed forward more. Still a fun IEM though I would definitely recommend them given you get some different ear tips and a cord if you have an extra (it\u2019s not horrible).",

Here are my issues:<br /><br />1)  The first low battery warning occurs about 5 minutes before the battery dies .  So if you just started your jog, or just got on the bus, you're screwed.  With 6 hours of play time, the low battery notification should give you at least 20 minutes notice.  Since you are almost always &quot;out and about&quot; when listening to headphones, it would be nice to have enough juice to finish your activity or get where you are going.<br /><br />2)  The low battery message (which is verbal) repeats FREQUENTLY for the brief remainder of your battery life, constantly interrupting your music.  This is so annoying you wind up taking the earbuds off.<br /><br />Since the earbuds are essentially useless once you get the first low battery warning, the warning serves no purpose.  Giving the low battery warnings at the 30, 20 and 10 minute marks would be far less annoying and actually give you a chance to get to a charger.",

        "text": "I've tried a few of these DVD albums, and this is best of the rest. The insert section is roomy enough so you only have to fold along one line and it will slide in comfortably  thus you can see the front and title edge. With Bellagio, you have to double fold, and it creases your insert more than you might want, especially if you think someday you might resell them -- messes with the aesthetics. As far as room, I can slip in 2 inserts, moving one up and under the blank space above and keeping the other low, so able to utilize every slot without feeling like I'm cheating myself by not having both inserts. In addition, for those annoying 3 disc DVDs/BluRay sets, you can slide one of the discs in with the insert, and it will be safe there. It's a sturdy product. I've been using my 240 count for 3 years now, and just bought a 120 in June. The 240 has held up very nicely, and I expect the same of the 120. If you have a large collection you want to transfer, you might want to do some planning ahead of time on how you want group your DVDs, because once you have packed your album, it is difficult to move pages around to reorganize. I had to remove my DVD and inserts. As long as it's not packed, you can manage. The metal clip is very strong and it's a firm hold, but when the slots are full, the bulk of it slides all the pages out because the pages are slick. I didn't have help to hold them in place, and you're going to need it. Leave a few empty in your groupings for new DVDs. The pages themselves are a good quality plastic and soft backing to avoid scratching. It's nicely balanced. I would recommend the 120 more than the 240 because it's easier to carry and store when full but as I said, my 240 has held up very nicely in 3 years. It is currently about 16# full. I don't carry the 240 by the handle. Don't want to push my luck. I can find no damage or weakening in it and every single original page is double packed with CDs  & Inserts, plus, I swiped a few pages from the 120 to put into the 240.  The downside is, if the pages ever do start to rip or tear, you can't find refills -- I've looked.  I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone wanting to get away from cases and consolidate your DVD collection.  I just haven't found anything else I'm happy with.",

Also, it breathed life into the premium speakers of my old car--simply unbelievable; I never heard them sound so good (the DAC's line-out was fed into the car's aux-in). My tracks came from Amazon HD Music.<br /><br />As a gadget aficionado in general, I find this DAC well-designed, functionality- and aesthetics-wise, and with a solid build and classy finishing that clearly distinguish it from the other DACs in this price range.

        "text": "02/16/21<br />I've been using the Q5s TC for some weeks now mainly with Apple Music and sometimes the SIRIUSXM app for iOS on my iPhone 12 Pro. Just a days ago I decided to check out MQA music on TIDAL. I have multiple headphones and settled on Shure SRH1540 and SRH1840. I have listed a number of headphones in other reviews so I won't go there. Anyway, WOW!!!, what a revelation. Listening to MQA's through TIDAL is very revealing and at one point on some recordings I had to say to myself, \"there were anymore detail and layering I would be able to taste and smell it\". I can also easily hear what I can assume is in some cases budgets, engineering and anything else that might affect the way a recording sounds.<br /><br />Now from my understanding the Q5s does not unpack the MQA music file but it appears. it's definitely seeing and recognizing the file, if not totally able to unpack it. I say this because the indicator on the front glows a solid yellow which according to FiiO is AptX HD, don't know but it makes a difference. Talking about spacial clues? all over the place. But of course it depends on the recording. I can say this, listening to all my old new music, from Aretha to Soundgarden and more is so much fun and enjoyable.<br /><br />I'm a ex-audiophile that actually love music more than the equipment (most of the time). The Apple AirPods Max reviews and rages made me revisit headphone collection. After selling 3 and decommissioning 1 I ended up with my mostly hated (not by me, I love the way sound) Sennheiser HD700. Measurements and other people's bias' aside I decided to put a dac/amp in my setup for my iPhone 12 Pro. The Q5s plugs right into my iPhone via the supplied connector with no issues at all. The bluetooth works great as well. I prefer direct connection over using BT mainly because I want to as close to the true signal as possible. AAC sounds great through this dac/amp combo. I can't hear a real difference the 2. The Q5s is a solid and professional quality dac/amp combo. It does get a little warm while running but nothing that concerns me. I'm also using the Shanling UP4 which is to my ears good too and serves another purpose in modest collection. The Shanling is not capable of plugging directly into the iPhone but does a really decent job with BT. I prefer the direct connection ability of the Q5s. Of course like I mention the build quality is  in a different league as it should be due to the price difference between the 2.",

The frequency response with 0.39 seems a lot smoother.<br /><br />The Q5s sounds different from Q5.  It's a clearer, more detailed sound.  I also like that the bass level is a little higher with the OFF setting.  I use ATH-M50x headphones.<br /><br />So, FiiO, if you are listening, here are my new suggestions:<br /><br />a) Replace the microUSB port with USB-C. It's a much more reliable connection.  microUSB gets loose over time.<br />b) Have a bass switch or knob that allows for more bass settings.  Actually, the EQ feature on the FiiO app is probably a better way to go, assuming it is remembered when not using the app.  I have not tried it yet.  If that's the case, why not get rid of the base boost button altogether?<br />c) Have different sleep timeouts for charging vs. not charging.  Add 1 hour, 2 hour, and Never as possibilities to each.<br /><br />Non-FiiO problem: macOS and iOS do not support Bluetooth aptX HD or LDAC, so I will need to wait for 24-bit/96khz over BT 5.0.  I submitted a bug to Apple.  I hope others will do the same.",

        "text": "First, my purpose is to stream audio to wired QC headphones from my AV receiver, as a replacement for my broken analog FM TV sound transmitter/phones.  For THIS purpose... I bought a pair of these BT devices, and it works, but the sync between audio and video is - versus analog - perceptible.  The streaming generation is less sensitive to this, but AV-philes find it annoying.<br /><br />It is a problem in all BT, compressed audio, technologies - to some degree. Compressed audio requires buffering, buffering introduces some minimum delay, and the delay can be worse depending upon the nature of the audio.<br />For many programs (sports, etc) sync isn't a problem, but in close-up talky-talky scenes the audio lag is annoying vs. the FM phones, which have imperceptible lag.  For NON-SYNCed applications - this is a non-issue.<br />I wish Roku had a AV sync setting (+/- ms).  This is what BT 5.0 does - it delays the video based on the estimated audio lag. *But that doesn't help here because these devices do NOT control the video stream*.<br /><br />Otherwise, audio quality of BT vs FM is equivalent. My FM phones were very good (AR, $150) and audio was excellent, so the BT pair has good sound in this application.  I have not noted any static others reported, except for a slight hum when the RX is not connected.  Generally, the BT audio is equivalent to any other BT audio connection (ie., streaming iPhone to car stereo, etc.).<br />8/18/2020 Revision:  After a power outage, I noticed a VERY bad hum.  Removed RX side's power, no change.  Removed TX sides power (from USB outlet on cable box), NO HUM.  I tried several other USB outlets, each had some hum though with different qualities.  Finally, I got out a good high amp USB hub & used it to power the TX side - no hum at all.  SO... the transmitting side is VERY sensitive to ripple in its USB power circuitry.<br /><br />One VERY annoying thing - my devices both power off after 4hrs (6hrs?)  regardless of input, even though both TX/RX devices are permanently wired to USB power. It ought to power down only if on battery or unconnected for some time (firmware update perhaps?).  Other than this obvious design choice, I have had no connection issues - power on TX, then RX, connects reliably in ~10s.  Once connected stays reliably connected UNTIL it powers down.<br /><br />So the good:  Cheap solution to use superior wired headphones.  Small & USB powered, so hides away easily on both TX and RX sides.  Cheaper & more versatile than quality FM TV transmitter/phone combos.<br /><br />And the bad:  Audio LAGS behind video noticeably, 50-150ms.  Also, I haven't tried with multiple BT sources - but there is no UI, no way to select a specific source - I suspect this would be a problem for some.<br /><br />Overall:  For the price, I can't complain and wouldn't spend 5x for good FM TV audio phones.",

I just ordered the ear pads only, and ended up using the spare two fake leather head pads that came with my G35 headset.<br />- Other thoughts: Not sure what some people are complaining about, but my ear pads are comfortable and fit my headset well. I\u2019m just going to assume some peoples ears are extremely sensitive than others to certain fabrics. I like the cloth mesh pads compared to the original leather pads for two reasons. The cloth won\u2019t crack or peel off like the leather pads, and the cloth pads are more breathable for the ears (ears won\u2019t get hot or humid).",

It comes delivered in a protective, flip-open box, and the pads themselves are soft and comfortable. It's every bit as nice-fitting as the original pads. But most users will probably need to do a few things to perfect the sound.<br /><br />1. Adjust the EQ. If you use an HD800, you probably use either an amp or some kind of EQ setup. When you use these pads the first time, you may notice that certain music is too bassy, or has too much treble. You can easily change the sound signature by playing around with the EQ. You'll find that the bass has more presence with the Dekoni pads, but I didn't notice much change with the treble. If, however, you don't use an amp or adjust the EQ, the sound will sound better with the stock Sennheiser pads.<br /><br />2. The &#34;sticking point.&#34; Sennheiser's stock pads are soft and resilient, and designed especially for the HD800. The Dekoni pads sound equally good, but some might find the sheepskin a little &#34;tacky&#34; at first. (I got used to it pretty quickly.) Also, the Dekoni pads are notably more warm-feeling than the stock pads. If either of these are a problem for you, you can upgrade to the Dekoni &#34;fenestrated&#34; pads - or just use the Sennheiser pads.<br /><br />3. Looks. No question, the leather pads are notably attractive - a real improvement over stock.<br /><br />4. Installation. While Dekoni includes a plastic tool to help pry the pads, you would be well advised to watch a few videos beforehand. Dekoni didn't include an installation guide.<br /><br />These pads are a no-brainer improvement over stock.",

        "text": "Love the wonderful sound of these cans however, some things to note before purchase:<br /><br />1) Very Heavy (Probably the heaviest I've ever worn.<br />2) Cups swivel 360 degrees. This can tangle the wires easily if you are not careful.<br />3) Mine came with a defective cable with an intermittent right side connection. I've requested a replacement. Discovered that the only ones making a replacement for this is Monoprice .. Though they do offer an upgrade cable for around $35.00 that looks far more substantial.<br />4) Wood ear cups are stained very dark (walnut color).  So much so that you cant really tell there is a beautiful zebra wood pattern. Would suggest that manufacturer offer non-stained version.<br />5)  Metal frame is a little unwieldy  (read large ) and somewhat flimsy.  A new frame design should be considered.<br /><br />All that said, they sound wonderful , so the other faults must be taken into consideration along with their reasonable price.",

        "text": "Yes. Versatile. These come from the factory as closed headphones and sound good in their stock form but where they really shine is if you convert them to open back headphones. You can google \"1060C open mod\" and you'll find a couple different companies selling the plates to mod these to open. The driver was designed for an open back headphone, so that is why they sound better when you open them up. There are ways to leave the wood cups on and turn them into a semi-open headphone as well and that will give you the benefit of improved SQ with a little less sound leakage but I think it's best to just switch between closed and open. Anyway, I've really enjoyed having the ability to switch from open or closed depending on the environment I'm in. Super useful. That said, I probably won't be taking these to the coffee shop with me, they're a bit too heavy for that.<br /><br />As far as the headband is concerned, the other reviewers griping about it are correct, it sucks. However, I don't think it's bad as some of them have made out. Maybe it just works with my head shape but I've worn them for several hours at a time without any issues. I plan on getting the ZMF Pilot Pad ($30) and I've read that that basically solves any comfort issues with these.<br /><br />The cable looks and feels just fine but beware that it is a little microphonic. I ended up buying a replacement for $17 on Amazon and that solved the problem.<br /><br />All in all, I think these are great headphones. There are a couple of issues but they're solvable and once you solve them (ZMF Pilot Pad + new cable), they are outstanding in both their sound and comfort.",

        "text": "First I like sound! I'm an audiophile at heart but in my life now I'm an audiophile on a BUDGET! These are my first bluetooth speakers. More on that in a minute.<br /><br />I was looking for on ear bluetooth speakers with a budget of about $50 to $60 and was set on waiting for a sale on the JBL EB45T but then saw these recommended on the wirecutter website (a pretty good review site in my opinion)<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with these, but nothing really right about them either. They have a nice neutral sound that you can listen to for a long time. For movies and youtube on my computer, they are great. But there is nothing in the sound that is going to wow you either. Trust me if there was something actually wrong with the sound, I'd be telling you. You can listen to these for a long time without ear fatigue. If you are looking for lots of rumble for movies, these probably aren't the right phones for you. But if your movie listening requirements are more modest then these work well for that. For casual background music, podcasts, audiobooks, they will work really well for that.<br /><br />Isolation is not great. I think the plastic is thin so a certain amount of noise gets in. I wanted to be able to hear a little bit of background noise, things going on in the house, but these push my limit for how much I want to hear. Even though they were open-back my Sennheiser HD-229 did a better job with isolation because of the design of the pad.<br /><br />Comfort isn't bad and for my ears, the ear cup size is just about right size. I wish the earpieces swiveled a bit more but for my head, they swivel just enough. . They have a left and right and the cups swivel so little that if you have them on the wrong way you will notice.<br /><br />Bluetooth... These are a pain in the backside on Win 7. When I want to use them I have to go and delete the previous pairing, pair them again and then go to the control panel and set these to be used for output. For movies on the computer, they get out of sync. I even set my movie player (Pot Player which I highly recommend) to use the Bluetooth headphones and they still get out of sync with the audio. I don't know if it's the player, the USB Bluetooth adapter, Windows 7 or some combination of them together.<br /><br />I like that they can be used with a wire as well as with bluetooth. The controls are a little small, as mentioned by others but I don't have trouble working them.<br /><br />I also tried the JBL EB45T Bluetooth headphones, which cost almost twice as much, at Target and these sound better overall. The JBL might have had better highs, a little punchier bass but these are more cohesive across the frequency range with nothing tweaked to make them sound 'better'.<br /><br />Summary: I don't have any other Bluetooth headphones to compare these to but I think most people would be very satisfied with these at this price point for general use. If however, you are looking for audiophile on a budget, it's not here.",

        "text": "My experience with JVC up to this point has been with video equipment and televisions. My experiences have been positive so I hoped that this would be a good set of Active Noise Canceling (ANC) phones. I have worked with a lot of ANC phones \u2013 Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, Philips and more. Almost every set I have used has had some flaw, either in the ANC or in the sound profile. These JVC phones are interesting in that regard. The sound profile is nearly spot on, but the ANC is on the conservative side.<br /><br />I\u2019ll go over the ANC first. This is not a real competitor for the high end Sony or Bose sets and if the main thing you want from a set of ANC phones is noise elimination then these are far from the strongest or most aggressive. I have a fan that I use as the main test for ANC phones, and with the most aggressive phones the fan is almost completely wiped out. The JVC phones do cancel a good bit of noise, but it leaves a good bit of sound behind that Bose in particular eliminates. Now, that said, ANC headphones that can cancel more than these are almost universally much more expensive, often by double the price. These are what can probably be called \u201cgood enough for most\u201d. For me, I like a more aggressive headphone, but these cancel enough ambient noise that when I am listening to music I don\u2019t hear much else.<br /><br />Many ANC phones fiddle with the sound profile to compensate for some of the lost frequency response, usually in the bass range and at the expense of the midrange. These phones are very unusual in that they don\u2019t really seem to impact the sound profile much at all. And, the sound is very balanced. The bass is good, not overdriven (if you have ever used Dre Beats or Monster phones, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about). The midrange is warm and music sounds like it has the right depth as a result. The highs are clear and vocals sound very clean. The sound profile does not seem to be different between when the ANC function is on or off, though turning on the ANC does enhance the volume (which you can observe by having the headphones off when you activate the ANC in the middle of playback.<br /><br />The ear cups are comfortable and I can wear these for a while before I need to take them off for comfort reasons. They don\u2019t seem to get too warm when wearing for a while which is good. They\u2019re not the most comfortable phones I have used, but they are better than many.<br /><br />They connect via Bluetooth and I had no issues pairing and connecting them to my phone.<br /><br />My favorite feature is that there is an independent volume control on the headphones themselves that does not change the volume setting on the source device. This is a feature that is a bit unusual; often, when the phones have a volume control on them it impacts the system volume when adjusted.<br /><br />So, there is one thing about these phones that I think needs some improvement. Included with them is a cloth bag for protection, and that\u2019s just not going to cut it, particularly in this price range. A bag prevents the contents from getting dirty but provides no damage protection. For the asking price (presently $149) these should have a hard case that at a minimum provides crush resistance.<br /><br />I am very pleased with these headphones, more than I expected to be. They sound great, though the ANC is passable. My biggest issue isn\u2019t with the phones themselves but with the lack of a suitable protective case. Hopefully JVC will resolve that issue in the near future. If you want a good set of ANC phones without spending north of $300, these are worth a look.",

        "text": "I have a very good pair of Bluetooth Sony earphones with pretty good noise cancellation, but I wanted a second set that could be used with a regular 3mm plug with my phone. Traveling brings enough aggravation without worrying about battery life on one more gadget.<br /><br />These are very comfortable on the ears for an hour or two while listening to an audio book and my ears don't get hot. These are light enough not to cause cauliflower ear either. I tested the noise cancellation feature both at home with the tv and in a semi truck idling. Those trucks are pretty quiet inside compared to standing next to one outside, but the noise is still there and it impedes sleep if you're not used to it. I'm pretty pleased with how well these block external noise - it's an absolute difference and a little better than my Sonys.<br /><br />Music is a pleasure with these also. There are adjustments to increase bass etc if you're so inclined. My primary use though is audio books. The full production Audible Originals with a full cast and sound effects are especially nice with these headphones - you can hear the background noises and details clearly and not the dog barking next door. I find myself reaching for these almost every day lately.",

        "text": "Yes, my Bose is a a couple years old, but it cost twice as much as this JVC unit, and Bose has a nice hard shell case, but this JVC works great.  It comes with a nylon mesh storage pouch with drawstring, 3.5 mm cord (great for in-seat entertainment on newer jets), and (short) charging USB cord.  It arrived too late for a recent flight to LA, but sitting in the kitchen with a 20 year old refrigerator running, and a central air conditioner running that sounds similar to a 737, I put these JVC headhones on, turned on the Noise Cancelling, and ... virtual silence!  Word of warning for those new to noise-cancelling headphones, they won't be miracle workers in \"open office\" or cubicle workplaces, but will help reduce that type of noise a bit. Huge bonus: if using just the noise cancelling (NC) features and not the music/BT feature, 35+ hour battery life is claimed.  Even with NC and BT, 16 hours is claimed.<br /><br />Next step:  Add some music!  Listened to some music and turned the NC on and off, and back, and could hardly notice ANY loss of music fidelity and tonal range.  Some cheap NC headphone tend to just clip certain frequencies.<br /><br />Nice and comfortable.  Over the ear design is the only way to go.<br /><br />Easy to pair; you can use the standard pairing, or if your phone have NFC, you can open your BT settings page, and tap your phone on the \"N\" NFC logo on the left earpiece, and a pop-up asks if you want to pair to the JVC.  Yes, I did.  No more scrolling through a long list of BT devices available (wretched Tile and air furnace filters, my Bose that shows up as a \"Zebra Machine\", etc.)<br /><br />And yes, in BT mode, these have a microphone so you can take and make phone calls.  Microphone quality is okay, not great.  There are controls on the headset to increase volume, lower volume, switch to next track, previous track, accept phone calls, etc.<br /><br />So if a mesh bag and so-so microphone quality are good with you, these are a great choice.",

I have to admit that I've always passed up JVC thinking that it was my grandfather's brand and that Beats must be better because their more modern, boy was I mistaken.<br /><br />If there is one thing I appreciate is really good LOUD and clear music.  I want to hear the producer coughing in the background when I sit down to listen.  These headphones provide me with that level of sound.  What's more (and even better) is that other people can't tell how loud my phones are.  With the Beats, I would sometimes get double-takes at the gym if someone can hear my music.  Not because of the genre but because of how loud they are.  With these, no one can hear my music.  Mine all mine, and I'm not forced to share my playlist with the guy on the decline bench next to me.<br /><br />The noise cancellation is better than Beats.  If someone is next to me and talking directly to me, then I can hear muffled sounds but not actual syllables and words.  But far away noises are just actions in silence, gosh that's perfection.<br /><br />I have those miniature cloth shower-cap thingies to put on the phones to keep them from getting icky but I don't think these will be for the gym. I think these will be after-work, cognac and cigar phones to listen to the classics.  Nice.",

If you're looking for the intricasies of fine tuning, how good is the base and all that, I'm not the gal for you. However, I think music sounds great, and they're perfect for listening to YouTube vids on my computer and audio books on my phone. The app is interesting. At first I thought I could talk directly to my buds. \"Hey, Skullcandy!\" (First earbuds I've had with voice control.) But you have to use the app for that feature. Not quite as convenient in my opinion, although perhaps I was expecting too much. The controls are not touch, but require clicking on the individual buds to control them. You can also control them through the app, though. Instructions are clear and easy to understand. I was up and running in minutes. All in all, I think they are excellent and definitely worth the price tag.",

        "text": "With Bose, you never have to worry about the sound quality.  It is excellent as usual.  The 3 different sized of ear pieces provided allow for a personalized fit.  They stay in place during all sorts of activities (running, yard work, etc..) and the soft earpieces are very comfortable.  The cord is split into 2 pieces which can be very convenient at times.  Without the extension, it works perfectly for an arm/exercise band.  With the extension, you can stick the phone in your pocket, backpack, etc..  and have some cord to spare.  The connection between the extension and the main cord is large and will make the cord feel heavy at times.  My ONLY complaint is that the cord is made of a very &#34;rubbery&#34; material and it tends to catch on itself (if you wind it up when not in use, it is a little tough to untangle it).  Other than that, I love these headphones.  I liked mine so much, I bought a second pair for my wife, who uses them regularly as well.  HIGHLY recommended.",

I used to go through headphones on a monthly basis, but Bose provided me with the quality and durability I was looking for with sport headphones. I one time accidentally put these headphones in the washer and dryer, because they were left in my pocket, and they still work with no defects. (Sweat-proof and maybe even waterproof) They are great for staying safe while running or biking outdoors, while still providing excellent Bose sound quality. I like the interchangeable earpieces for the perfect fit and comfort while running. There is no need to readjust or worry about the earpieces falling out or getting yanked out. The versatile cord length was a bonus for less cord hassle, but if this product were to be upgraded I might suggest a flat cord for less tangle during storage.",

        "text": "I lost accurate track of time, but it was definitely more than 60hr of battery life. very impressive, a little scary to carry this much power on my head, but logically I understand that risks of catching fire or batteries exploding is negligible)<br /><br />* sound quality - awesome (in terms of sound itself)<br />* build and material quality - impressive<br />* bluetooth connectivity - awesome. range, stability, reconnect speed, sound quality (in terms of losses via bluetooth while in varying range of \"hotspot with music\").<br />* battery quality - a little bit over a week of daily uses for 8hr+ a day. just perfect. That will be enough for a business trip out of town for a couple of days and back without need to recharge and sometimes even without prior notice to recharge before I go.<br />* distinct controls (bumps with space between them) - awesome. easy to use, easy to locate, no mistakes)<br />* folding capabilities - they do fold/unfold, but I tried it only once upon unpacking, but I rarely use this feature<br /><br />The only minus that I can see in the last 20 days is how the headband is stretching when I'm wearing headphones. Looks dangerous (in terms of longevity). That's all I think. If this headphones will last more than a year I would call them perfect for a price and capabilities (tiny note about non ANC version and that's it)<br /><br />So final score (while they last) 10/10",

        "text": "With the onset of Pandora, satellite radio and many other such options, I found I wasn\u2019t playing my CDs anymore.  In fact, I couldn\u2019t find my CD player!  And the high-end system in my truck doesn\u2019t even have a CD option.  So when I saw this I figured I give it a try.  I like that it\u2019s portable and plays without skipping even when bumped, running with it, or the dog knocking it off of the table.  It can be used with my several different sets of earphones.  It also plugs into my truck stereo without a problem.<br /><br />I also wanted it to play through its own speaker while in my crafts room.  This is where the 5th star gets removed.  When turning it up nearly all the way the speaker starts to buzz on certain notes.  It isn\u2019t loud at all on its own either so using it without auxiliary speakers is not good if more than about 8 feet from it.  However, I am playing my CDs which I have not heard in years, and that makes me very happy.",

        "title": "The Moondrop Chu is dead. Long live the new king.",
        "text": "Well the Moondrop Chu's reign didn't last long. These WILDLY outclass everything under $50. They wildly outclass a lot of stuff under $200.<br /><br />For starters, detachable cable. I hate the fixed cable on the moondrop chu's with a passion - it's all silicone rubbery and tangles, doesn't stay in place, doesn't stay tied up in your pocket or backpack. The chu's come with a microphone, which is the only thing it has going for it, but if you REALLY need a cable, these are still a far better deal with another $10 spent on the cable. This cable is nice, comfortable, wraps up easily around 3-4 fingers and stays coiled properly.<br /><br />Then, eartips. The Chu's \"springtips\" don't really fit quite a few people, myself included. They were so bad that the chu's sounded downright broken until I got some better tips on them. The Zero's come with about five different size of tips that were no problem to find a comfortable seal/fit.<br /><br />Comfort and build wise, they're awesome. My ears can be quite picky, and they basically disappear in your head. They're light and smooth plastic, with a nice stainless steel plate on the outside.  No complaints, they just work perfectly as IEM's and feel plenty durable to just live in your backpack.<br /><br />Sound wise, these things really up the game. The Chu's have excellent technical performance (detail is great) but they're downright claustrophobic. It feels like every instrument in the band is licking the inside of your ear. And it's unpleasant. They're tuned quite neutral, but with no sense of space, instrument separation or imaging (that sense of more than left/right, but front/back and in between) they're just not a pleasant sound. The Zero's have IMPRESSIVE separation and imaging. Not impressive at $20. Impressive for IEM's, period. There's $300-500 stuff that doesn't do imaging and soundstage this well.<br /><br />The bass could be cleaner and it doesn't quite hit the detail of the chu's (which are also punching well into the $500 range in that one specific area) but I'm nitpicking HARD. For $20, these have no right sounding so spacious, detailed (you can enjoy the detail a lot more when the instruments don't feel all laid on top of each other) and pleasant. They're not overly bassy, but they are thumpier than the chu's. No overly sparkly either. Just a very \"grown up\" tuning meant to make music sound nice, paired with truly outstanding soundstage.<br /><br />If you play video games, there's nothing anywhere near these in the price range. You'll hear sounds ahead, behind, and how far away they are.<br /><br />Songs with real detail and separation will dance around you (Bobby McFerrin, Polyphia) and show you things you didn't even know were in your music.<br /><br />The only next step up I can think of from these is the $50 Truthear zero's (same model name, different brand) but they're only marginally better (with a slightly worse fit) and the $100 7hz diokos are a very noticeable step up in every way. But jeez. These things are $20. I don't understand how they're so good for that little money.<br /><br />Anyone else entering the $20-$50 space better bring their A+ game. These are a tough act to follow. If you really need a microphone, these are still unbeatable with another $10-15 for a cable with one.",

Coming from Google Pixel Buds Pros, these were a significant improvement in sound quality but given the abundance of excellent budget headphones in the chi-fi market, I can't comment as to whether they're better than any of the others you'd find for a similar price.<br /><br />I also really like the USB-C 2-pin cable that it comes with. It has a subtler finish compared to twisted cables and it also has a built-in mic that works well enough for calls. I actually bought a higher end set of IEMS and ended up using the Salnotes' cable since similar cables cost 1-2x the price of the Salnotes themselves.",

I was dropping my airpods constantly before I had this case (as I have butterfingers) and this case has helped reduce that drastically. I also like that I don't have to take the case off the lid before I open the airpod itself. (You gotta watch out for those as they can be very annoying to do every time you want to open your airpods). I posted a picture of my case and put my white airpod on top so you can have a better comparison of what the color looks like.",

        "text": "update::: I've been having issues with connecting this hub to a capture device.  it will constantly disconnect and reconnect.  I purchased an hdmi splitter that has it's own power source (micro usb) and I connect it with the ipad and the capture device.  It's like a middle man... and now the this hub stops disconnecting and reconnecting.  It's very odd.  Also, connecting power via the USB C port, on the hub, does not help.  It's also not a heat issue because I bought a mini fan to blow on it and it's never hot.  However, it doesn't disconnect and reconnect when directly connected to a monitor/tv.. it works fine then.<br /><br />in addition to that issue, I had to get a replacement and noticed that both hubs displayed different color profiles.  Using the same monitor, cables, ipad, etc.  One was sort of washed out and one was very saturated.  Also one wouldn't display 4k (only 2k) and the other one would display 4k, 2k, 1080p, etc.  Not really sure why there would be so much variance with the same product.. I guess QC issues?<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />This is the \"UPGRADED\" version.<br /><br />So far it works as advertised!  Gets alarmingly HOT.. concerned about longevity of the hub itself and concerned about potential damage this could do to my iPad...<br /><br />This product advertises \"Heat vents\" but they're just cutouts for the ipad's speakers.. it doesn't actually vent the inside of the hub.  This seems deceptive.<br /><br />I've tried those $20-30 cheap usb c to hdmi + charging port options and they all didn't work properly... mostly they wouldn't actually charge the ipad while outputting the HDMI signal.<br />This device actually DOES charge while outputting the HDMI signal properly.. which is great.<br />The audio port works fine, but I have not used the USB ports as I don't really have any use for them at the moment.  I mostly needed hdmi output and a charging port that actually charged while hdmi was being used.<br /><br />I love how the company included 3 different sized spacers to accommodate for ipad's with cases.<br /><br />The switch to disable the hub is a nice feature. BUT I wish you could disable the charging while still being able to use the HDMI out... so if this switch instead only disabled the charging capabilities but still retained the ability to output video/audio via the HDMI output, that would be, imo, better.  Then when the ipad's own battery gets low.. I could flip the switch and allow the hub to start charging.  Obviously I can just unplug the USB C charging cable from the hub, but it would be a QoL feature to not have to do that.<br /><br />I like how it has a long-ish cable instead of just having the usb port extend out of the actual hub body.. this makes it much more versatile, imo.<br /><br />My biggest concern is how long this product will last due to how HOT it gets while using the HDMI out and charging the ipad at the same time.  This is the only time the hub gets alarmingly HOT.. when one is using the HDMI out AND charging at the same time.  One could argue that because it's so hot to the touch, that means the passive cooling, inside the hub, is doing its job.. but I don't know if that's actually the case w/o seeing the internals and seeing what kind of heatsinks or w/e are being used.  All I know is that this hub gets VERY VERY HOT and devices that overheat tend to stop working sooner than later.<br /><br />Overall I think this is one of the better options available for 30-50$.  The versatility of attaching to the ipad or have it hanging is a huge plus for me.",

        "text": "So far the only bummer is it\u2019s not really screen protector friendly. I used the thinnest insert because without one it won\u2019t stay in place.<br /><br />It\u2019s a bit too snug to put on an iPad 11 with a screen protector. The edge of the protector kinda bubbles up. I\u2019ll have to try a few thin cases and not use the inserts to this adapter. That would be more beneficial anyways.<br /><br />One thing I did notice about the charging port is it\u2019s a bit loose. So you may need to get new cables or try different brands. I have several brands/styles and some do better than others. The Apple cables seem to fit fairly snug though.<br /><br />Other than that it works as stated. I do like it and it\u2019s more low profile compared to others. All of the ports work especially for charging multiple devices. I use 30w+ for my iPad because I tend to use adapters often. 30w brick & adapter loaded still charged iPad under use.<br /><br />The adapter looks nice as well. A bit thick but not to the point it\u2019s an issue using it. I have the model with the on/off switch. That\u2019s convenient while otg, in case you need to cut power from the adapter to save the battery from draining.<br /><br />The adapter doesn\u2019t seem to take a ton of power but if you don\u2019t need it on while away from a power source I\u2019d say just flip it off.<br /><br />Overall I like this adapter it\u2019s nice & convenient. Like I said my biggest gripe was not really screen protector friendly (iPad w/out a case only screen protector) but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. I\u2019d recommend trying this out!",

That will create better sound insulation. The memory foam is about 11mm high, the largest diameter is about 12mm, and the inner diameter of the catheter is about 3mm.Made of high-quality, environmentally friendly and non-toxic materials, it has the advantages of softer, slower rebound and more durable. Memory foam is characterized by a slow rebound effect, which can change its own shape with external pressure. From the perspective of earplugs, the ear canal varies from person to person, and the memory foam will change their shape according to the individual's ear canal, making them fit the ear canal best, thus achieving more than ordinary eartips cover good wearing comfort, better noise reduction effect, bring better listening experience. Applicable to the following earplugs: SE series:  SE110/SE112/SE115/SE210/SE215/SE310/SE315/SE420/SE425/SE530/SE535/SE846 E3C/E4C/E5C/E3G/E4G/E500/i3C/i4C/ SC series: SCL3/SCL4/SCL5/",

There's a lot of oomph for such a small package. Unless you're used to professional grade sound equipment, these will cover most anyone's sound needs.<br /><br />SMALL EAR HAVERS! I have been on a quest to find comfy earbuds. So far, these have come the closest. I can wear them for like 2 hours with minimal discomfort. This is a huge upgrade from \"most cause physical pain near immediately\". When placed correctly, they're pretty solid. I couldn't shake them out. They did come loose a handful of times and needed to be readjusted, but in comparison to the others needing that every 5 minutes? I'll take it.<br /><br />They say they have ANC, but honestly, I'm not so sure. In my personal experience, turning ANC on didn't actually cancel any noise. It just brought the bass out. Unless I just can't get the right fit, the ANC mode is effectively just a \"make the music sound better\" button.<br /><br />The drawback here is that you can only use ANC if both buds are in. Not usually a problem, unless you want to pop one in to listen to music and leave the other ear open for communication. The make the music sound better button won't do anything with just one bud.",

        "text": "I needed a replacement for my Galaxy buds pro's that have the fatal ANC \"roar in one ear\" that Samsung won't fix, and they don't stay in the ear. Bring an absolutely ENORMOUS fan of the 1more comfobuds z (the single best sleep focused earbuds at any price) I liked that these are also small, the case shape is wonderful (flip top, tiny, wireless charger) and they're relatively inexpensive.<br /><br />The sound quality uses 1more's app to do a \"sounds\" hearing preference test. I would prefer a proper EQ option but it works well enough. I prefer real audiophile iem's and headphones, but enjoyed the Galaxy buds on bass boost, they almost hit like planar magnetics. These are about 80% there. They're totally serviceable, with the only standout being a pretty good technical performance, with genuinely solid imaging and separation. They absolutely do need the soundID set up though, I hate the stock tuning. For tiny little things they are, I am perfectly happy with the sound quality when I want music on my bike or public transit.<br /><br />The ANC is stellar. They have a specific mode for wind reduction that downright curbstomps Samsung and apple. If you ride a bike, you need 1more ANC buds. The transparency mode is great too, very natural sounding. It doesn't have that \"talk and it switches to transparency\" gimmick, but I found it obnoxious on Samsung.<br /><br />Touch controls are easily customized and no \"single touch\" feature means you don't accidentally press anything readjusting or putting them in. Auto pauses when you take one out, your can use just one or the other no problem<br /><br />The app features depend on the product but these are meant to be usable for sleeping, do they come preloaded with a library of sleep/ambient sounds. I just use my own but it's a nice feature. I can easily fall asleep with them in and I'm a very picky side sleeper, but I do prefer the absolutely microscopic comfobuds z's.<br /><br />The stock eartips did bother me a bit, they have a little ridge from the mold that irritated my ears after a few hours of use. They have a very odd mounting system that I was only able to find one option for, spinfit 1025 tips are shallow enough to fit and still let the case close (the wells for the eartips is a bit to shallow, id like it if they addressed this on a revision) so if you don't like the tips, spinfit 1025's.<br /><br />The case magnets that hold the buds in are hilariously strong. Your have to SMACK it to dislodge them. Very nice detail. The case size is tiny and perfectly shaped to slide into pockets, with a flip top that you can open one handed<br /><br />For being so small they also stay put well. Not perfect, but I can work out or mow the lawn, an impossible task of the Galaxy buds pro.<br /><br />Overall though, these things rock. They're exactly what I need as a paramedic who also rides a bicycle. 1more is a serious brand with some seriously well thought out products at extremely competitive prices. I can sleep on my side with a podcast and still be able to wake up for a call, they crush wind nose when I'm riding my bike, they sound perfectly adequately tuned with impressive imaging (once you run the sound id feature once) and the case is (slightly too shallow recessions for the eartips aside) very nice in the hand and perfectly shaped.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",

Excellent. But these in-ear headphones sounded bad. No low end, mid-rangy. Only manually pushing them I could get a better sound, but always too much towards the mids and mid-high frequencies.<br />I had higher expectations with them, knowing the brand. I thought they could be headphones I would like and trust to listen to music, and also being able to do exercises. I'm not 100% sure now, but I think I remember I couldn't keep them on while running and sweating.",

        "title": "Great Sound With Comfort And Stability",
        "text": "This is an excellent set of Sports headphones that sounds great and stays put when you're getting your workout in.  The headphones use a dual magnet, dynamic moving coil micro speaker to deliver a frequency response of 10HZ to 19kHz making them more than adequate for listening outside of the gym as well.  While these headphones work with any device they are truly made for the Apple line of products (iPhone, iPad, iPod) as the control box gives you control over the volume, skip tracks and even take calls.<br /><br />\u25ba\u25ba SOUND QUALITY \u25c4\u25c4<br /><br />The sound across the board is excellent from the low-end through the mid-range and high-end.  They are not as open and airy as my Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10's, a set that listed for $399 retail, but they don't feel muted at all when listening to them.<br /><br />Testing through a variety of music genres it would seem that these are tuned for the louder, upbeat music that you'd listen to while working out which makes sense since these are Sports headphones.  With that said if I would have no problem listening to acoustic music through these as they product a nicely balanced, clean sound that is better than a lot of wired headsets I've tried.  They are way better than the headphones included with my iPhone.<br /><br />\u25ba\u25ba COMFORT \u25c4\u25c4<br /><br />For me comfort is just as important as sound quality because if your in-ear monitors aren't comfortable you won't want to wear them for extended periods of time.  This set does a couple things right in the comfort arena with the design of the oval earbuds and the over the ear wire design that keeps the headphones in place and makes them feel as close to weightless as you can get.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical of the oval design of the earbuds as I am very used to the circular design and have been very happy with the Comply tips that I normally use.  With that said the oval design here truly does seem to make a difference in the comfort of these tips as the included tips are more comfortable than most, if not all, of the standard tips I've had included in a set of headphones.<br /><br />\u25ba\u25ba CONTROLS \u25c4\u25c4<br /><br />There is a small control box attached to the clip that you can use to keep the cord in place.  The control box is very similar to those on other sets of headphones I have tested and it worked pretty much as expected except for the way you move up and down in the track list.<br /><br />The top button on the control box is used to raise the volume on your device.<br /><br />The bottom button on the control box is used to lower the volume on your device.<br /><br />The center button is the most versatile as a quick click will play or pause your music or answer a call if the phone is ringing.  A double tap of the center button will move to the next track in your track listing and a triple tap of the center button will move to the previous track.  Pressing and holding the center button for a second will initiate Siri.  While I am used to the volume buttons normally doubling up as the previous / next track control once I was used to this system it was a breeze to use.<br /><br />\u25ba\u25ba PHONE CALLS \u25c4\u25c4<br /><br />The headset does a nice job with calls due to the fact that the microphone is nice and clear so there is no worries about taking a call while wearing these headphones.<br /><br />\u25ba\u25ba CONCLUSION \u25c4\u25c4<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent set of Sports headphones that are both comfortable and sound great.  They stay firmly in place and seem to be built to handle whatever wear and tear you will throw at them while working out.  I love having full control over my iPhone with the included control.  For me this is about as close to perfect as you can come with a Sports set of headphones.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.",

        "text": "Diggin' these just fine. I can see how maybe people with tiny ears, or oddly shaped ears, might not have the right fit. Also, the portion in-ear is quite tiny, so there's not a huge amount of bass, but I still like the clarity, and there's enough adjustability to tailor the sound, even on my tiny Sandisc Mp3 player. What I like the most though, is the over the ear design, and I can have the wires feed out back out of my way. The portion in-ear, with the smallish oval tips, also makes me quite happy. So small, and un-noticeable, and comfortable, and they stay put till the end of my hike, or run, or skate, or whatever. The ones that came with the player sounded good too, but really annoying and would fall out when you get sweaty or turn your head. And I just didn't have a bunch of the new-style design to try out, with the horn on them that you rotate and lock into the ear. I read that those kind still fall out when sweaty and slippery anyway. (or you don't get the right fit). All problems solved with these sporty little guys. And Klipsch speakers and equipment have always impressed, so I'm glad I trusted my instincts...",

        "text": "Withings wearer for almost two years here. Have had the Scanwatch for a couple months and had the Steel HR before that.<br /><br />First off, if you're reading the reviews you should definitely buy either this watch or the Steel HR. I absolutely love it. It's gorgeous, the app is great, it fits in well to daily life. Looks fantastic whether suited up or wearing grubbies to work on the car. My doctor even hooked up tri-leads to me to compare the ECG with actual medical equipment and they thought it was pretty darn close! Same with O2 sat monitor and heart rate. Quality wise, on par with its excellent forerunner, the Steel HR. The functional twisting crown with haptic feedback is a nicer touch than the push button on the old one.<br /><br />I have to ding it on one star because of the battery life and charge time compared to the prior model. My Steel HR lasted for about a month with all features enabled and charged almost completely in the time it took to take a shower. This one lasts about five days with all features enabled (I know, there are more features). But the bigger problem is charge time. I take the watch off for showers and that's a logical time to charge (obviously you want to wear this in your sleep). About 30 minutes does not come anywhere near to fully charging the battery. Just now it only went from 30-40%. So you need to find time to charge it during the day or occasionally not wear it while sleeping. I think I'm going to disable some of the continuous monitoring features which puts me back at my Steel HR just with sleep disturbance monitoring and O2 sat on demand.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you want activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, enhanced sleep monitoring, ECG and O2 sat WHILE still wearing an attractive watch, this is hard to beat. If you don't care about ECG, O2 and sleep disturbance tracking the Steel HR is the watch to get as it's more or less the same just without those features and is cheaper. As to whether the ScanWatch is with the extra money over the Steel HR, I think that depends on how much you prioritize those extra features and battery life. If this would last a week plus on a charge I'd say the extra hundred bucks is a no brainer. But battery life as it is... tougher call.<br /><br />One other note. While this watch will give you notifications, they're a bit cumbersome on the small screen. I have it turned off.",

        "text": "Update:  Watch now 10 months old and does not keep accurate time.  Initially a couple months ago, I noticed the time difference and using instructions adjusted it, thinking it must have been an odd glitch.  I am used to watches that rarely need to be adjusted and thought a Hybrid Smartwatch would be smart and never be off time.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Since writing the original glowing review, last May 2022 which was two weeks after purchase.  I have had to adjust the time several times.  The first time it was off it was 12 minutes difference.  Right now it is off 5 minutes.  A couple weeks ago it was off 4 minutes.  This is not an isolated incident.  Interestingly, the hands do not match the digital time, but all the same, both are off.  Right now the hands read exactly 4:30 while the digital is 4:31 even though the real time according to my computer and Samsung S21 phone is 4:36.  This is really a shame given the watch cost $300.  IMO, the watch is unusable if you cannot trust it for its most basic function.",

Has all the bells and whistles of name brand products. While I prefer fitbit due to familiarity.<br /><br />I havent put it entirely through its paces. I noticed that it was registering nearly same heart rate as my fitbit sense. I havent it worn it long enough to determine blood oxygen. There is still a lot to learn. The learning curve feels a little clunky compared to my fitbit.<br /><br />Has ability to connect to Alexa, take and make calls, music. Can make changes through app or scroll through the screen face.<br /><br />The watch band fits my 7\" wrist and feels comfortable enough. Typical silicone band. It is attached via pins, so I imagine it is possible to swap it out but not sure. I may try some old bands to see if it is doable. I'd also prefer for it to have a soft protective cover (bumper guard) to protect screen and edges.<br /><br />I still prefer the ease of using a name brand, but this has a good looking interface. Main thing is to see how accurate it is. I think it has been fine for heart rate, steps, but will need more sleep time for seeing how well it tracks sleep and oxygen.<br /><br />I dont rate on price, but I comment. This is pretty reasonable, but it looks like there are many similar products for less. So compared to a name brand of similar features this is a bargain. Compared to other no name generics, this is competitive. Some are easily $20 less. I noticed the price on this vacillates. I think I got it for $70, and have seen it as low as 35-40.",

        "text": "I will avoid the facts that this watch is outdated at launch by its hardware (processor). That, coupled with retail and even discounted price also are out of step with the competition. These two big gripes aside. The watch is good and likely the best choice going into 2023 for pure Android Wear OS users (not looking at Apple or Tizen overlay users.)<br /><br />Its not perfect and Pixel users will benefit the most when paired to this watch. Its lost most of the lag recent watches from other Wear OS brands. Has all the sensors the majority of buyers could want based on watch tech right now. It swipes, it plays well with the apps made for it. It gives you the info you ask of it. There are even a few nice 3rd part accessories now to avoid Google Gouging for proprietary bands. And there are few quirks I hope they iron out soon. Mainly, when the phone is in Bedtime Mode. Make the watch do it too, or add that Zen Mode feature to the watch also. It sucks to have animals tripping the security cameras outside dinging on my wrist and killing my sleep score. The snooze/do not disturb button on watch fails too easily and you have turn it on/off manually everytime.<br /><br />As many claim, the battery sucks. Sort of. I can go up to 36+ hours on a slow day, and many others can too. It will depend on too many factors to list. But basically your popularity with notifications and thinking you need the screen always on are the biggest battery hurdles. Most can get use to touch to wake. And maybe only having text, phone, front door doorbell and one email be allowed to bother your watch with notifications. Do you really need to know what cousin Billy had at Dairy Queen when he posts the same pic/vid on Facebook, Instagram, Tic Toc and YouTube, etc. Find a nice balance of wrist information along with what sensors you need checking if you are still alive. You can start the day and track everything till the next morning when you charge it again while you shower and get the next day started. It charges quickly. And most other Wear OS watches have the same daily charge requirements. Nobody on Wear OS is winning on battery. Or Turn every setting all the way up and have a spare charger puck ready for a mid day juice. If you go that route. I suggest a quick release band to ease the removal of the watch.<br /><br />So, its not up to the level or price of the Ultra Apple Watch. And if you don't care for Samsung. Your love for stock Android will eventually lead you back to this watch. Unless you forgo ECG sensors. The price will drop soon. Cases are minimizing the fragility of an ALL glass jelly bean design. But when comes to keeping your phone pocketed and yet still have info relayed in a useful way. Pixel Watch is the best current albeit not perfect solution for now.",

        "text": "I'll start with the pros because sadly there aren't many. It feels premium and I personally like the small footprint on my wrist as it's not heavy and is comfortable with the band it ships with. Everything else leaves me wondering why I've stuck with Google this long. Battery life is the main reason I returned this watch. If you don't ever touch it, leave the screen dark, disable every feature you can and leave battery saver on constantly, you'll get at most 20 hours of use per day because the thing can't make it a full 24 hours, even when you aren't wearing it at all! I have to charge 2-3 times per day (twice if I do no exercise at all) and it takes around 1.5-2 hours to charge, which seems excessive given my phone can charge from 0-100% in 28 minutes. When you aren't charging, you have to deal with no spo2 sensor (even though it has one), AFib tracking doesn't work constantly and the speakerphone is ENTIRELY UNUSABLE. It crackles when turned up loud enough to almost hear it and when it isn't crackling it's not loud enough to make out voice. You can't even hear the Assistant talk and the alarm wouldn't be noticeable if not for the vibrating. This watch makes me want to spend thousands to switch back and be an Apple customer after years of leaning towards Google for everything. This watch was a swing and a huge miss. This watch doesn't even compete with 5 year old watches out there. Not sure what Google was thinking, but it's making me reconsider being a Google Fanboy as no other Android watch checks all the boxes. My other complaint is the FitBit Premium membership needed to keep most of your data long-term unless you export it elsewhere (which isn't too difficult). Ultimately this experience pushed me to decide to not use a watch for now and I'm going to quit using Google Fit on my phone as I feel I should be getting paid for them to keep and sell my data to others. My other negative is the impact that this has to the environment. While the manufacturing process already did enough damage, this watch needs so much electricity to  stay alive that it will cost me more than the watches value to keep it charged, creating more unnecessary environmental impact and costing me more in electricity daily.  I can't even believe that I came to these conclusions because I'm a techie/nerd and usually need all the latest/greatest products.<br /><br />Would not recommend this subpar watch, most likely will convert me from Googles [clearly] subpar Ecosystem. Even Fitbit Sense (which Google owns) gets at least 6x battery life and has more features, but Google made lots of promises for that watch that they still have yet to deliver - so I'm going without a watch now. Very sad this is what they released as their first watch. Maybe they should have waited yet another year if this is all they could do? Everyone I know that got a Pixel watch returned them and everyone I knew that wanted one no longer does. Pretty sad, but you sure aren't getting what you're paying for here. Google needs to remember who their customers are...",

        "text": "I bought my Pixel Watch LTE direct from the Google store. My husband got one too. We both have the Pixel 7 pro + pixel buds pro to use with it.<br />After about 3 days the battery stabilizes and becomes quite good! I get between 21-26 hrs depending on how much I'm using LTE+GPS. My husband got 30 hours because he works so doesn't use it as much during the work day as I do.<br />It pairs immediately with the pixel buds pro so answering the phone, using assistant, listening to streaming music, responding to text messages with voice, etc is awesome!! Sleep tracking works great tho I wish there was a way to have it automatically go into bedtime mode rather than have to remember to manually do that.<br />I have both Google Fit and Fitbit running on mine. They work great. The HR sensor actually matches my chest strap which is crazy. It does auto track workouts- you can't see it until you're done. I'm bummed Sp02 isn't turned on and fall detection isn't on. The bands are way expensive so we got the leather band in order to be able to pick out whatever bands we want. Really it's a great smart watch if you're into something that can be dressed up or down and works seamlessly with pixel. It's also great if you're not into the heavy giant watches and just want something comfortable on your wrist with good haptics. I could write more but I think that's enough. Can't wait for updates and also think gen2 will be just incredible",

        "text": "I have owned just about every smart watch from Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fossil and Microsoft and all of them have had their issues. The Pixel Watch is not necessarily perfect out of the box either but, in my opinion, has already proven to be the most accurate wrist-based heart rate monitor I have ever used which is invaluable to me. I can finally ditch the chest strap for weight lifting workouts which is a game changer for me. I know it will only get better with time as Google works on future updates too.<br /><br />Battery life has not been a problem for me but I am not using it as much as some and I don't typically track sleep so that is not a factor here. I mainly use it to get hourly reminders to move and for my main workouts, which I do at least 2 per day, and it works great for that. My workouts include a variety of HIIT/Cardio, Strength training, walking and yoga and this sucker tracks them all with extreme accuracy which I have tested against my trusty old chest strap. Great job Google. Keep it up!",

I downloaded the app and proceeded to pair, referred to as \u201cbind\u201d in the manual. The smart watch paired effortlessly with my iPhone 13.  Other than pairing or unpairing, the user manual doesn\u2019t cover much else, but I found the watch use to be intuitive.  I do think a more detailed user manual would be helpful to explain navigating and swipe direction of the screens.<br /><br />The watch has many functions and I was pleasantly surprised that the watch provided a \u201cSiri connection\u201d and performed flawlessly. I compared the blood pressure and oxygen sensors to my individual monitors to check accuracy.  Surprisingly, the watch is pretty accurate.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I started using the watch with 46% battery life and wore the watch for approximately 25 hours before I received a low battery alert.<br /><br />This is a great buy and so much so, that within hours of using my watch, I ordered another one for my husband.",

I have an Android phone, and it only took a few minutes to pair the watch with my phone.<br />First enable Bluetooth and find the device listed as \"C20\"<br /><br />Next, download the app that's shown in the QR code. Once you have the watch paired via Bluetooth to your smart phone and the app is downloaded, your watch ready to go, and should be syncing to your smart phone. The connection has been great thus far; it hasn't disconnected/lost connection to my phone.<br /><br />As someone who has suffers from pulmonary lung disease, I was very excited when I found out this smart watch has the capability to track my oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. In addition, you don't have to do anything, the watch will automatically to measurements periodically throughout the day.<br /><br />It's helping me monitor and compare results over a few days. I suggest authorizing Google Fit so your hearth history is accessible when it. For me, it helps to have a history when I meet with my pulmonologist.<br /><br />The watch has great standby battery life, and it's light weight. After m three days  it's only dipped minimally in available battery percentage. I highly recommend this!<br /><br />**Updated**<br /><br />So it's been several days now since I first posted the review and I am amazed how little the battery has drained. Needless to say this smartwatch has fantastic standby battery life; especially considering it's constantly looking for/measuring heart rate. As you can see from the photos the readings are very accurate. I own a pulse oximeter and a blood pressure monitor to keep my pulmonary hypertension in check. My resting heart rate is 95 bpm, which may seem high, but the reading is accurate and normal which makes this product more the reassuring.",

It does so much right but it feels incomplete and overpriced to me.<br /><br />First off, the screen and overall build quality is amazing. I have a Galaxy Active 2 as well and, candidly, this Zepp watch is better in pretty much every way in terms of build. The glass feels better and more scratch resistant. You get a stainless frame instead of aluminum. The shocker is the screen. I am not sure how but this watch looks brighter and crisper to me. The size is really nice as well. The Zepp E has a lower profile and almost no visible bezel. If hardware was the lone consideration, this would get a near perfect score.<br /><br />The battery life is also really outstanding. I get 5 to 7 days with this. It has a proprietary magnetic charger that works well. Even playing with it often and tracking regular workouts doesn't seem to bother it.<br /><br />I also like Zepp's approach to overall health measurement. The PAI (Personal Activity Intelligence) score tries to give you an overall measurement of how healthy your days are. Once you understand it, I think it is a good general snap shot. If everyone tracked their life like this, the world would be a much healthier place. Sleep tracking is good as well. In line with what I have gotten from Fitbit and Samsung though you need to make sure to set a daily screen timer as it doesn't automatically know to turn off the screen when you are sleeping like the others.<br /><br />From here though things begin to slip. At $250, there is no onboard GPS. This is a big omission at this price. There also isn't auto tracking for workouts like most others have so you have to remember to physically start tracking workouts. There is no onboard music player though you can control your music from the watch. Interacting with your notifications and inbound calls are all but worthless. Zepp's app is also a mess. It is cumbersome and not well thought out. Everything you want is there but it often takes alot of effort to get from one thing to another. Samsung's app is vastly superior. Lastly, the watch comes with a leather strap. At the time of this writing, Zepp has silicone straps listed on their site but they don't appear to be available yet. A watch that is focused on health should come default with a silicone strap.<br /><br />I guess I am just not sure what Zepp set out to accomplish with this watch. Is it a smart watch? Not really. Is it a fitness watch? Kind of. Its like they tried to split the baby and ended up accomplishing neither successfully. If you want a good looking everyday digital semi-smart watch with a great battery life, this is worth considering but, for most, at $250, there are better options out there. Perhaps Zepp will update this product and make it more well rounded. If not, I would suggest waiting for a price reduction before investing.",

Returning this junk.<br /><br />I bought these so I'd have something other than the band that came with my Fitbit Charge 5. These are okay. They look fine, but they are really, really long, with no way to shorten them. I have small wrists (5 3/4\") and as you can tell from the photo, the end of the band comes almost to the watch face on the other side and sticks up. I did eventually pull the tab so that it lays flat, but I'm not used to having the end of the watch band on the side. The product description online says it fits a wrist 5.1\" to 8.7\". If my wrist was any smaller, the band would probably cover the watch face. Unfortunately, there wasn't a \"small\" option.",

When we go hiking, we get identical information, the 7S doesn't need L5 GPS but it works fine.  I like the addition of the touch display.  Lastly, Garmin is finally getting their act together on software, the 6S and 7S both work well with Garmin Golf and Connect, lots of good data and charts.<br /><br />There are a few more data pages on the watch for me to look at than on the 6S.  I suspect the 6S could have them too but Garmin wants you to upgrade.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you have a 6, wait for the 8, maybe it will have ECG?",

However, this time, one side kept disconnecting and the attachment site looked defective compared to the other side causing me to almost lose my Fitbit twice. Luckily, I was indoors and heard it drop. I will return it and try a different brand as I fear I will encounter this issue again if I simply replace it.  This style is nice because it's easy to put on and off even with a single hand as opposed to the type of bracelet that comes with the Fitbit.",

        "text": "I wanted a band that would have more variability in fit, and I liked the color, so I ordered this.  It is, indeed, compatible with the Fitbit Sense and I enjoyed it for several days until I had to charge my Sense.  I then discovered that the magnet was so strong that I had difficulty keeping it off the back of my device long enough to get the charger on.  I was worried that strong magnet might damage the circuits and contacted FitBit for their opinion.  They weren't sure, but pointed out that they do have a hook-and-loop wristband in-house that is available.  Since I was also having trouble with the edges of the VNCAS band getting caught on my wool shawl and anything else fuzzy I wore, I decided to ditch it for the FitBit brand option.  Sorry, but I can't recommend this one.",

        "text": "Initially when I bought this watch band, I thought it was nice, solid and seemed to be well made. I've been wearing it just a little over 2 months now and there's some sharp little burrs that have now showed up on the watch band itself and the edges of the other parts are now seeming to be sharp as well and keep getting hung up on my clothing and have also scratched my boyfriend several times. The finish is wearing off on the backside of the magnet connector area so now it looks very tarnished. I do wear it everyday all day long, but I don't feel after such a short period of time it should look so bad and have these sharp edges now. Unfortunately it's past my return window so I'm going to have to just throw it away and get another one. Such a shame because I really like the magnetic band and the color. I'm a little bit leery about buying another similar style for fear that the same thing will happen again. \ud83d\ude33",

        "text": "I normally don't like smart watches because I hate the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on something with a non-replaceable battery that will wear out in a few years rendering the watch useless. Even though I do love my new Instinct 2 watch, I'm still not crazy about the wasteful business model of smart watches, and am not sure I will buy another after this one. That said, the Instinct 2 is a near perfect watch in almost every way... it is feature packed, fully customizable (without being over the top), has a long battery life, and is very comfortable as a daily driver watch.<br /><br />I use mine for the usual day-to-day watch stuff, and hiking primarily. I don't use any of the smart phone or health features (heart rate, pulse ox, etc.) as I don't care about them. I use the compass, altimeter, and gps tracking features frequently, and they all work great.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic watch for what it is. However, I really, REALLY hate that it has a non-replaceable battery that will inevitably wear out after only a few years. I know that this is the case as I had a Fenix 5 before this one that lasted about 4 years before the battery began dying quickly. It essentially became a $500 door stop after that...",

Within a few months, the screen will be difficult to read; the device will decrease in resale value and be embarrassing to show other people. Lower-quality disposable screen protectors seem like a temporary solution for keeping your device looking brand new; though they need constant replacements.\nThe Only Screen Protector You'll Need\nWith this problem in mind the founders of Skinomi set out to create a screen protector that's tough, reliable, and long-lasting. Their solution was the Skinomi TechSkin.\nMade of a thermoplastic urethane film that is designed to resist abrasion, the TechSkin Screen Protector compatible with the Sony Smartwatch provides impact absorbing military-grade protection for your device. The protector is UV resistant, HD Clear, and goes on invisible. A smooth texture and feel makes it easy to navigate your device as if there was nothing applied. The flexible high-grade film is formulated to be\n\"self-healing\"\nwhich makes it able to stretch, absorb, and even repair scratches and impact damage.\nLifetime Guarantee\nWe're so confident that you'll love the TechSkin that every Screen Protector comes with a\nLifetime Warranty\n. If the Skinomi TechSkin wears off, we will replace it.\nThe anti-bubble installation process is easy and error-proof.

The company gets five stars, but I've got to deduct one for the soft material.  Skinomi did include a squeegee, but it's too big for use with this skin.

        "text": "I have owned this watch for a year and a half now. I use it almost daily for my walks/runs, weight workouts, and indoor bike workouts. The main reason I chose this watch in the first place was because it was one of the smaller ones available. I am 5'9 but have small wrists, and really disliked the 'utilitarian' look of larger watches. After a year and a half, I am so tired of the issues with it and ready to jump ship. If I used this watch more regularly (I only wear it for workouts - not all day), I would have switched a LONG time ago. The amount of people who have complained about the same issues for YEARS without Garmin doing anything makes me hesitant to purchase another Garmin product, especially with the Apple Watch, Samsung, and now Google buying out Fitbit and coming up with a watch.<br />- Spotify on this watch seriously sucks. If you check Spotify forums, you will find COUNTLESS threads of suggestions for the Spotify app on this watch that should truly be basic features at this price. Do they implement them or listen? No. Also, there is no way to contact Spotify customer service - you just get pointed towards their 'community forum' where you have people complaining of the same exact things with no fix. You can't skip forward on any track, at all. I listen to a lot of podcasts when I walk. Some are 2 hours in length while my walk is only 1 hour. This watch constantly either reverts to the very beginning of my podcast so I have to start all over (because again, you can't skip forward - so have fun listening to ads as well!) in anything, only updates 1 song out of 15 on my playlist or get the error 'sync failed', or some other random issue. Also, if you have a playlist on Spotify, you cannot choose the track you want to listen to. You have to hit the >> button to get to where you want. Really? I hope Garmin drops Spotify because they have been a truly horrible app on this watch the entire time with no effort to make updates. Take a look at the reviews of Spotify on the Garmin store if you don't believe me.<br />- Battery life is a couple of days. However, there are points in time where my watch will be at say 80% the night before, I get ready to leave and go my walk the next morning, pick up my watch, and it's at 8%. WTF? This happens enough to be super annoying and apparently is not an 'only me' problem. It appears to be tied to when the watch updates.<br />- I tried to wear this to track my sleep in the beginning and gave up after two nights due to the extreme disco effect of the 'gesture' motions. I tried turning on the 'do not disturb' function advertised on the watch which is supposed to disable this stupidly bright light that WILL wake you and whoever is next to you up. Didn't work. Do a search for 'Garmin watch lights up in middle of the night' and you will find all sorts of people complaining of the same thing, and not just on this version of the watch.<br />- GPS has issues connecting and can take several minutes which is pretty annoying when you try to start tracking an activity only to see a red bar when trying to connect. I 'sync' my watch to my phone constantly so that is not the issue. I have switched between the GPS options Garmin offers on the watch to no avail. Search for this issue as well and you will see lots of people with the same complaint.",

        "title": "This is just a 22mm silicone watch strap, ignore the smartwatch stuff if you're using a real watch.",
        "text": "Recently Amazon had a sale on a watch I like, a Seiko Solar 42mm faced 22mm lug analog watch.  A real watch, that tells time, day, date and that's all, what we in the watch enthusiast world like to call a \"tool watch\".  Because it's a  tool for telling time.  Period.  I\"m a semi-retired IT engineer and have more than enough screens in my life, I don't need nor want one in place of a real watch too.  This watch runs for 10 months on a full charge from a light source and never needs a battery replacement, eat your heart out 3 day smartwatches.<br /><br />I decided being as the watch is black with a sort of stencil font on the face indices that I'd take a chance on this band and accessorize it with a military-looking Army Green silicone band -- Because I do not wear permeable (leather, nylon, canvas, cloth, etc.) watch straps I decided an Army Green silicone band was the way to go with the new watch and put the canvas band that came on it in a drawer.  I don't wear NATO straps either, first because they're permeable nylon (permeable is a no-no for me) and secondly because to me they look like someone tried to tie their watch on their wrist with a chunk of old seat belt.<br /><br />This band fits on a 22mm lug's spring-bar perfectly.  It's very easy and fast to remove or replace too.  I've tried to get it to let go of the spring-bar \"by accident\" and it's on there very solidly, at least as solid as any other system.  I have a rather large 8\" wrist and there's room to spare on the band.  It's also very quick and easy to remove or replace, I wish more bands would use this kind of system.  I wish more bands came in this length too, it's hard fro me to find one that fits without strangling my hand.<br /><br />The \"keepers\", the little loops that hold the tongue of the strap in place where it emerges from the buckle, have lugs on them that fit in the sizing slots on the band.  That's a GREAT extra feature because those keepers tend to wander up and down the watchband without those lugs to hold them in place.  This can cause either the tongue of the band or the keeper to snag on something which can break the band or the keeper loop.  No problem with this band, the lugs on the keepers stabilize them exactly where you put them.  This is something that is not shown nor addressed in the product description and very much should be.  It's a deciding factor for me and I might have returned the watchstrap if it didn't have those lugs on the keepers.<br /><br />The band is about the thickness you'd expect and has no discernible taper from lug to buckle.  Being silicone it weighs very little and does not appreciably add to the weight of the watch and strap combo.  It's just a good, plain, non-reactive, non-absorbent, military looking watchstrap.  That will fit on any watch, smart or otherwise, with a 22mm lug.  I don't know if I'd use this strap on an Omega or a Rolex, mostly because those are much heavier watches than the one I use the strap on.  It's a little plain for a multi-thousand dollar plus watch too, I think there are better choices.  But for a watch I got at less than half price and intend to wear every day to save my nicer watches the wear, tear and scratches that come with that kind of use ... This band works perfectly.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with it is that I could do without the little \"smart watch\" triangles, of which there are three.  One on the buckle and one near each lug attachment.  But that's a very, very minor issue and not worth taking a star off my review over.  I knew they were there when I ordered it and this is a style thing not a failure in design and materials thing.  This particular watch that I'm using this band on has a very similar little triangle on the bezel above the 12 o'clock indices so it looks like the strap was made for the watch ... sort of.  Actually now that I look at it some more, it looks quite natural.<br /><br />We'll see how long it lasts, I just got it.  If it has an unreasonably short service life I'll come back here and add an edit to this review.  If you don't see that addition, what I say here stands current.",

        "text": "This CNPGD Smart Watch Fitness Tracker had the potential to be really great. In terms of appearance, the body of the watch combined with the band are sleek and attractive. The watch is available in 4 different color schemes (Black, Pink, Red, and Blue/Silver) and each looks aesthetically pleasing. I received the Black one and really liked the clean lines and modern design. The band fits around the wrist comfortably as well.<br /><br />Before trying to turn the watch on, I decided to charge it fully overnight. I followed the instructions and photos on the instruction sheet and tried to remove the band from the watch's charging port end. Unfortunately, it was so difficult to remove that I thought I was going to damage the watch or the band at some point as I worked up a sweat trying to pry/pull it apart. I finally managed to insert the lip of a plastic spoon into a sliver of space I had gotten between the band and the watch. I kept working at it until I was finally able to get the band off. I really do not look forward to repeating this process.<br /><br />Once the watch was charged, I downloaded the WearFit 2.0 App and after a couple of tries, was able to pair my phone with the watch. There are some annoying aspects about the App. In one area, I was able to specify customary units such as pounds and feet versus the default kilograms and centimeters, but in another area, I was unable to make the change. When using the watch, as I started to toggle through the functions, I realized that there was no way to toggle backwards. So if I swiped past my desired function such as the stopwatch feature, I needed to swipe past all the other functions again until I got back to the stopwatch feature. Swiping right or left or pressing the Home button does the same thing and only moves the choice of functions in one direction, forward.<br /><br />I went out for a long walk and compared the watch's step and distance counter against my phone's fitness app with GPS and a very accurate pocket pedometer. After the walk, my phone fitness app, pedometer, and this watch all gave roughly the same measurement for the mileage. Unfortunately, the step count of the watch was about 2,000 steps off from the other two devices. it's unfortunate that this watch has so many annoying issues as the features such as the BP, O2, and other health trackers are quite handy. I would give this fitness tracker watch more stars if they just made some upgrades/updates to the app and maybe the watch's firmware.",

For the cost this watch does just about everything I need it to for way less money.<br /><br />A few things I love about the watch...the Battery Life. OMG the battery life! It lasted me a full week with wearing it to bed most nights, through multiple exercise walks and a few work outs, and hundreds of notifications from my messaging apps and phone calls. It's easy to clear the notifications I receive on the watch. I love that it tracks my sleep, heart rate, and stress levels easily. I also tested out in my pool for swimming and it was waterproof without having to shake the watch or turn on any special modes to keep it watertight.<br /><br />I haven't figured out of it auto detects a work out but that could be because I obviously don't work out that much.<br /><br />I tested it against my health app on my phone and they were pretty accurate against each other info steps and mileage. I can't figure out how to get the watch and the app to register my GPS coordinates to see the map of my walks but I could be missing the settings.<br /><br />The app that gives the data is easy to navigate and update any settings. Seems very similar to other track laps I've used.<br />A few things I'm not liking about this watch...<br />I feel like the band and the watch itself that comes with the watch is a little too big for my wrist. And I have a bigger wrist for a female at my size. The watch face is bigger than some of my friends apple watches and taller than my old Samsung gear fit watch. I can SEE notifications on the watch but I can't respond or give a quick response to any messages. For Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger I wouldn't expect that but for SMS messages I would like to be able to give a quick text back either by speaking a response or by selecting from some quick options.<br /><br />Those are really my only 2 complaints. I like this watch and will continue to use!",

I went to settings and pretty much turned the settings on for everything so that I could see if it would work.  It does.  I can check the weather, my temperature, blood pressure, oxygen, pulse and steps.  I can set it to a sport activity and there are multiple ones.  I was able to go to settings on the phone app and select 1 out of 152 different picture settings (and I can change it as much as I want to).  It came with the 2 bands- pink and light brown or tan.  I have only worn the pink band so far and it is soft.  The charge on the battery lasted a week, which is nice because if you just remember to charge it for 2 hours once a week on the same day, that would be easy to remember.  I have not really used the camera function but did somehow try it out as I twisted my wrist, and the phone camera took a picture.  I have not used the music part of the watch either, but that is because I do not have a music option on my phone right now.  The only issue that I had was connecting it to Google Fit so that I could attach that to the Walker Tracker App (which I use for competitions for # of steps).  That is okay though because I can manually put the daily steps in.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this watch.  I have never had an Apple or Samsung Watch, but with this one, if it breaks, I won't be crying like I would with one of the expensive watches... and it works for what I want it for!<br /><br />6/3/22- Update- this watch has been acting nuts the last 2 weeks.  I was hoping it would work itself out, but it has not.  The watch randomly buzzes and/or blinks.  Sometimes it zeroes itself out.  I am getting really frustrated.  I have asked a question above to see if I can get help, so I will see what happens and let you know.  I have only had it for maybe 6 weeks.",

Everything else was supposed to be a bonus for me.<br /><br />I had two separate doctor appointments yesterday and was alarmed when I compared the findings.<br />* Steps: When we discussed my new \"smart\"watch, the one doctor told me he's a runner and tries to get 10,000 steps daily even when he works. Apparently I walked about a third of that despite driving most of the day. GO ME!<br />* Temp: In the prior two days I wore this, my temperature has always read in the 95-96 degree range. Temp at both offices was NORMAL.<br />* O2 stats are probably ok, but that wasn't checked, at least that I paid attention to.<br />* BP: Here's a HUGE problem. It has consistently been reading at 128/76  +/- only 4 points on systolic or diastolic. But in both offices, my systolic was wrong by more than 30-35 points! I just came off BP medicine and needed to monitor it, so this was shocking, to say the least.<br />* Pulse: The other consistently incorrect reading. The watch has been reading between 90-110 at rest. This is alarmingly conceivable considering my health concern, which is why I went for one appointment to have it checked. However, after an EKG, my heart is fine and my pulse was actually around 70-80 at both offices after a little walking.<br />*Sleep: Since I have several issues with sleep, I looked forward to this info. Apparently I sleep while at my computer drinking coffee in the morning, as well as on part of my long drive home yesterday.<br /><br />So not that it even matters at this point, but the location and weather would never \"set\" on the app or watch either, even though I specifically turned on my location just for your app. It just stayed blank with lines. I guess that's better than telling me it's snowing when it's really 70 degrees, considering your other reliable results.<br /><br />Honestly, if you're going to market this as an activity tracker with health monitoring, then it should be able to give at least SOMEWHAT reliable readings. Mine weren't even close. I checked my temp, pulse, and BP manually the moment after it was taken in both offices to verify accuracy and it was so far off I thought I may be in jeopardy. So a big thank you for causing additional anxiety thinking my BP was only slightly high when it was way too high, and giving me tachycardia when it was only a bit elevated. Add my freezing temp and I should probably be close to death.<br /><br />This is one of the most disturbing, nerve-wracking items I've ever gotten on Amazon. Or probably anywhere.",

I have a lot of health challenges and so it's important for me to be monitoring certain aspects like blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. I'm typically someone who has high blood pressure have a pre-existing condition. This determines whether I can donate plasma, if I'm consuming too many calorie rich foods or if I should be concerned for my heart rate.<br /><br />I love how this watch is very mindful of how long you've been sitting because I'm guilty of spending hours on the couch. Despite my poor health, it still essential to get up every once in a while and move around to get the blood flowing. This watch has excellent battery life I've only had to charge it one time since I've had it and I've had it now for over a month! Even being connected to Bluetooth on your phone it does not drain the battery quickly which is awesome! Pairing was super easy, just download the app pair it and set it and forget it. The watch and my phone always per immediately I've never had to fuss around with anything just great! I would highly recommend this watch to anyone.

        "text": "I bought this watch because of the high-resolution display.  And that's what I got, no more, no less.<br /><br />Upon first impression, I can tell the display has crisp graphics.  The touch screen is responsive.  The processor is fast.  Overall, the phone itself is nice.<br /><br />The app, on the other hand, is awful.  It is intuitive, but it loses Bluetooth connectivity without reason.  This is the only app that I've seen that will move forward and backward during a dial sync.  When I switch to certain dials, the progress bar will reach 61%, then count back down to 60%, then 59%, then start going back up.  It's nice to see honesty in an app, but it's just strange.<br /><br />I didn't test notifications from other apps, but no SMS text messages came through.  The setup is simple and easy with SMS notifications settings on its own section.  But once set up, no messages came through.<br /><br />Battery life?  What battery life?  After a fully charge, this watch drained to 90% in the 15 minutes I used to overlook the features and set up the app.  This from a 330mAh battery.  At this rate, the battery will be depleted in less than two hours.",

Can't  say the instructions were the best, but I figured it out.<br />I always got the magnetic mesh band in rose gold, but it always discolored and no matter what i tried I couldn't get it cleaned.<br />This is why I tried a new band. A review prompt gave suggestions of different things to comment on. One of the suggestions was a mobile app. I have no idea what that had to do with the band. Maybe someone knows and can let me know.<br />UPDATE:<br />I've been wearing it 24 hours a day, except when showering or recharging the watch.  NO discloration, no running of colors (bracelet) and it doesn't get dirty looking like the metalic bands. I'm going to buy another one, just in case something happens to this. So worth the money.",

        "text": "Pretty good smartwatch. I needed something to replace my Galaxy Active, but didn't want to spend $100+ on something with a horrible battery life. I bought this one and for a while I was disappointed. I had to charge the watch each night and the steps weren't as accurate. I changed the setting so that the screen doesn't turn on when you move your wrist and that has saved the battery big time. I'm on day 4 and only down to 50% which means I'm now able to track sleep as well. I still think the steps aren't as accurate because it almost matches the steps in my phone's health app, but I'm notorious for leaving my phone places. I also miss being able to limit the options for exercise types in the watch face. I have to scroll through a long list each time. Overall, pretty good product for a cheaper price.<br /><br />Update: I originally gave this 5 stars, but I have to take 2 away. A few days ago, the watch all of a sudden stopped counting steps. For the price, it was perfect until it stopped working. Back to the drawing board.",

        "text": "*edit: I've found a con and it bugged me enough to update my review. If your phone is on \"Do not disturb\" and you leave your phone on at night for emergency calls, the watch still vibrates with every text, regardless of whether they're on your emergency list. This is annoying when you're a light sleeper and you get a text for go cart racing or Dairy Queen at 4 am. I'm assuming it would still go off with a call as well.<br /><br />I have a Garmin Vivofit that for some reason the notification vibrations will work for a couple months, then stop working for a while, then randomly start working again. I was sick of this, and went looking for something not too expensive and found this. I'm still getting used to it, but it vibrates when I get a call or text, so I'm happy so far. The band is very flexible and comfortable, which is nice, since my Vivofit band was a little stiff.",

        "text": "After charging for 30 minutes as instructed, I paired the smart watch with the app. This was easy, and the one reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The other reason for 2 stars, the interface was easier to use than I expected.<br /><br />But if the measurements are not accurate, ease of use doesn't matter.<br /><br />I bought this smart watch to track my heart rate while exercising\u2014mainly walking. After recent heart procedures, my doctor wants me to keep my pulse below a certain rate. Each time I measure, the pulse differs substantially from the pulse oximeter that always agrees with my doctor's office pulse oximeter, and heart monitor. It goes as high as 90 when the PO says 52. I took multiple measurements, including taking my own pulse. The closest measurements were 60 when the actual rate was 51 or 52.<br /><br />Support is through a chat on the app. I did not wait long for support, however they did not try to help me. They insisted that the heart rate changes. That I had to let it sync with the app. Not once did they address the possibility that the smart watch might be reading the rate wrong. Told me to try again after I had already tried multiple times.<br /><br />Focusing on anything but the issue I am reporting does not help me. Even suggesting I exercise and measure my heart rate. Telling me the human heart rate is constantly changing. Literally, answers like they were talking to a small child.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this device. It disappointed on two levels - Heart Rate, Support. I cannot recommend. Look for a different smart watch if you need accurate heart rate measurements.",

        "text": "This generally works well enough for exercise purposes. I didn't get the \"dangerous app warning\" on my iPhone, though I did get a warning that if I use the watch to display messages, then the app has access to all my contacts and the text of all my messages. I doubt I'm a target for Chinese spying so I chose to ignore that, but it's still worth noting.<br /><br />I love that it's waterproof, other watch faces are available (though I couldn't figure out how to restore the original, more-helpful one without doing a full factory reset), it tracks steps and sleep, plus it's able to measure heartrate and blood pressure. Mine sometimes tells me the weather, but only immediately after connecting to my Google account on my phone; otherwise it just says \"unknown\" (and honestly, if I have to click extra buttons on my phone, I can just check the weather there). It has a music playback control, but I couldn't get that to work. It also theoretically connects to my phone and lets me enter a phone number, but I couldn't click \"dial\" so that bit felt more like a child's toy, where you pretend to call a phone but don't actually do it. But since I use this for exercise more than connectivity, I'm OK with that.<br /><br />Some things are less than stellar, like their heart rate screen always shows a default chart (I don't think it ever lets you create your own heart rate chart)... and it shows a heartrate from 120-150 ALWAYS, which catches me off guard when I've been sitting at my desk for 2 hours. But I learned it's just a concept; there is no real *graph of my heartrate that I can find, just current / min / max that I can see from my phone. Or I can click \"measure\" to get my instant heartrate on my phone (good while exercising). Blood pressure can sometimes be measured from your phone (though it takes 1-4 minutes for some reason), and sometimes that screen disappears completely; I haven't yet figured out the pattern<br /><br />It doesn't seem to measure many things other than steps automatically; you have to select each one when you're wanting to see it. Soooooooo all told it's solidly mediocre. It's good for counting steps, manually checking heartrate, and manually checking blood pressure (very slowly) on occasion; otherwise it's a lot weaker than most smart phones",

        "text": "This smart watch looks nice enough - someone could easily confuse it for an older Apple Watch - and its easy to make custom watch faces (I put a pic I took at an Iron Maiden show on mine). And it is jam packed with features - way more than some other watches in this price range.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have trouble trusting its more advanced features.<br /><br />A number of times when taking my temperature the watch says I have hypothermia, measuring me between 87-95f. I am a 200lb man living in in Southern California and my wife won\u2019t turn the thermostat down below 74 degrees. I don\u2019t have hypothermia. If it can\u2019t properly read my body temperature, there\u2019s no way I can trust its accuracy with many of the other health features - blood oxygen, blood pressure, heart rate, etc<br /><br />That step count seems pretty accurate but ONLY once I paired the watch with the Da Fit app. Before I paired the watch, it measure me taking like 350 steps while just sitting on my couch. Not sure why it would measure differently paired or unpaired but it did - significantly. I would not recommend this as a fitness tracker for someone without a smart phone (yes, there are still a few people without smart phones).<br /><br />And the sleep tracker seems to at least get my sleep times accurate, though I am unsure how well it reads light/deep sleep as I don\u2019t really trust the readings from it\u2019s health sensors. I want to believe its doing a good job. I like the way the app presents the sleep timeline and information. But I just don\u2019t know if its accurate because the watch thinks I have hypothermia.<br /><br />As for the non-health related functions, they are pretty spotty too. I stopped receiving text notifications after a couple days and could not get them to start back up again without completely disconnecting the phone from the app and starting over again.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks like an old gen Apple Watch.<br />- Customizable face<br />- Lots of features<br />- Doesn\u2019t technically *need* a smart phone for many features<br />- Step counter seems accurate when paired<br />- Great battery life for a smart watch.

The watch kept telling me my heart rate was over 100 just around the house.  I have nsvt but my heart rate generally runs low.  So I'm very sensitive when I have palpitations - when this watch kept saying my heart rate was over 95 I wasnt buying it.  That brings into question any other readings or parameters.<br /><br /> I find the watch annoying and frustrating to use.  The watch face does not interact very well for me.  I'm constantly trying to tap it and it wont register so then the screen shuts off.  Another annoying thing is it tells you to start moving around when I'm doing housework.  I guess you can shut that off but I've really lost interest.  Hopefully Garmin can offer some fix for the reading since its past the return date.<br /><br />The positives - watch is comfortable and I don't wear jewelry.  I forget its on.

You have to open the back and then lift up the battery slightly. The sim card slot is located under the battery. You have to slide(left/right) and lift up the metal sim card cover like a door. Insert the sim card and lay the metal cover down over it and slide it into place to lock it. This watch is not waterproof. The watch works as specified except for the 2g calling. 2g service is not available in my area, so make sure you check if your area still has it. You have to buy your own sim card and they recommend Speedtalk service. Check their coverage map for 2g service.",

        "title": "Huge disappointment",
        "text": "I am a big supporter of Polar products, my M400 was an absolute beast. I've since moved on to the Vantage V and it's by far the best training watch I've ever owned. This watch was a mess from the start...<br /><br />I can't in good faith give this anything but 1 star, which it earned because of the HR monitor built in and I didn't seem to have any issues with tracking or accuracy, but that is pretty common faire these days and warrant just 1 star. I was just so damn tired of the HR strap that this was great at the time.<br /><br />The power use or battery life (could never figure it out) was complete garbage. I understand that the target demo for this watch was never the ultra-marathon crowd, but this thing could barely make it through a day let alone a workout within that day. I disabled the \"smart watch\" features, enabled the smart watch features, ran the battery dead between wears, tried to always keep it charged, etc., And nothing seemed to matter. The battery would go from full to \"not enough charge for workout\" so erratically that it felt like keeping this thing working was the real workout. Mid-run, EVEN AFTER DISCONNECTING FROM THE PHONE, it would drain so quickly that it was always a gamble if it would make it through a 3 hr run (tops). Also, when this thing starts dying, you lose your tracking data first, then the HR, then it's a brick on your wrist. All within about 14-15% to zero, which was also pretty erratic. The sleep monitoring features are a wash because you have to charge this thing constantly so it only makes sense to do it at night.<br /><br />The 2 button layout was a failure... Swiping is great (in theory) but the screen is pretty small, the gestures awkward, \"swipe to nothing\" screens  and such made navigation miserable. (Possibly an Android Wear issue but no one needs to change their watchface swiping in 2-3 directions.) Secondly, this is a workout watch, you get sweaty (or drenched here in FL). This renders the watch's screen completely useless and I can't tell you how many corners I stood at pressing the screen trying to resume a run, change the metrics on my screen, etc. The standard workout screen also requires you swipe down for some stats so you just give up after a while. For normal daily use, I kept changing watch faces (which were very clunky to modify) or ending up at the settings menu. An Android Wear update resolved some of this but very iffy at best.<br /><br />Once said run was done, syncing became an issue. I finally figured out that if you completely disconnected the watch, turned off any Bluetooth on the phone, did the workout, then slowly added the connections back, you had the best chance of the watch properly syncing with Flow and Strava. 60-70% of the time... If you forgot, all bets were off.  I don't generally run with the phone and watch, but the few times I did it destroyed the battery life because it kept pinging the watch (also may be Android Wear), even when the link was severed/watch disconnected.<br /><br />Onto the smart watch features. I won't beat a dead horse with the things noted above, but other than vibrating for calls or text messages, this was mostly useless. The slow response and connection time between the watch and my Pixel 2 had me constantly talking and repeating myself to my wrist like a lunatic. Then there are the 2-3 confirmations and need for a notary to send anything from the watch.... The mic idea is a good one and I suppose having the OK Google feature might be handy, but it mostly steers you back to your phone for anything useful, so I just ended up picking up the phone and bypassing the watch 90% of the time.  This of course is not to mention the drain on the battery... I was really hopeful about the wrist nav and Google maps since I travel a bit but it just didn't pan out and I continued to rely on just the phone.  They also sell that as a running feature (navigation) but you've got to pair with the phone so we're back to battery concerns.<br /><br />The watch itself sits in a rubberized strap for removal/cleaning, which makes it large/bulky. Was difficult wearing under a dress shirt as a daily activity monitor. The Vantage V isn't small either, but it has a more classic watch look rather than time-traveler band so it blends better and I can wear under a cuff.  If this watch isn't separated and rinsed after each use, it gets funky fast. Lotta nooks and crannies in there, be sure to clean it well or smell like a locker room. The band also doesn't breath at all so I would have to take days off wearing it because a rash would form. Wearing it loosely to help with this was uncomfortable due to its size so there wasn't really a win to be found there.<br /><br />Polar really missed the mark on this one and I was really bummed that this was the direction they were taking their product line. Thankfully, right at the apex of frustrations, the Vantage V came out and they redeemed themselves. It's not a small price jump and I don't know too much about the Vantage M, but literally anything would be better than this watch and the V is by far the most impressive item they've delivered on.",

I had a bad accident so was rehabbing for two years and had just started training in my gym and on bikes to compete again. I just got a notice in the mail, that the online training program will no longer be available I would have to buy a Polar Beat. I still need to know V2o, heart rate zones, training zones, so many other things that helped me train to my full potential. Even my Polar gym watches don\u2019t work. I guess I can throw them out, although they still work. That being said, they make a good product, but so many become outmoded so you have to keep buying them.",

        "text": "I've been using this smartwatch for about five weeks. There are tons of watch faces to choose from, but I couldn't find any with just the info I wanted at a glance: time, date, steps, and weather. I found one watch face with everything but weather and loaded that, but the watch face spontaneously changes several times a day to designs I've never selected. I don't like having to reset it with my phone every few hours to get back to my preferred watch face.<br /><br />It vibrates at random times and shows me (what I believe is) some sort of prompt to reset it. Sometimes it prompts me for voice commands or makes phone calls for no apparent reason. I erased my contacts, so I hope it won't accidentally wrist-dial anyone else.<br /><br />It needs to be recharged every 2-3 days \u2014 not every ten days as claimed for \"Bluetooth daily usage mode\" \u2014 and I'm NOT using the majority of its supposed features.<br /><br />I've reached out to customer support a few times, but they say I'm doing something wrong. I'm just wearing it; the glitches happen whether I'm moving or still. Support has been no help at all. I haven't been able to find information on how to make it work as advertised online either, but at least Google doesn't blame me for the faulty product.",

The lacy look makes it less apparent that the band is vinyl and the dark colors help to hide stains.  I have bad metal allergies nd was a bit afraid of what would happen with the clasp given it is metal and has some contact with my skin.  Been wearing this since December and the only time I have issues with a rash was when I had the watch fastened too tightly to my wrist.  I believe this was from trapped sweat and moisture and not a metal allergy reaction.<br />Extra great deal in that you get three bands.

        "text": "I just upgraded from the 6X sapphire to a 7X solar sapphire watch during Garmin's anniversary sale. It wasn't that I was unhappy with the old one, it's been invaluable, but there were just enough new features I decided it'd be worth a try. All-in-all I'm very glad that I did. I weighed the extra battery life from the larger solar array along with the ability to reuse my existing QuickFit 26 bands into my decision to keep the same size rather than go with something a bit smaller and, perhaps, sportier-looking. Fortunately I have big hands and wrists so it doesn't look overlarge.<br /><br />Others have spoken about the smartwatch in more detail, so I'll both be brief and focus on the upgrade process instead of on the watch itself here. Given Garmin's otherwise clunky software, I was amazed at how easy it was to configure the new device, download a watch face, and port over my data from the old one. Even with the firmware and map upgrades it only took about 20 minutes, most of which was downloading stuff and reconnecting the new device to my wi-fi and phone app. All I needed was Garmin Express (on my laptop) and Garmin Connect (on my smartphone).<br /><br />The bottom line is that the 7X looks great, works perfectly, has massively improved battery life, is easy to set up, and comes with a few extra cool features like the flashlight (which is far more useful than expected).",

I just wanted to see streets and location as I bike and not use my cellphone.  There aren't that many models that show real-time map, even the one from other brand that shows map, it lacks a lot of details or cross street.  Garmon fenix 7 was the most rebus in the lineup in term of map.<br /><br />Goods (mostly compared to my older suunto ambit 2:<br />+faster gps acquiring<br />+has heartbeat detector, so don't have to wear a chest monitor.<br />+fit nicely, I have skinny wrist and it is almost the same sixe as the height<br />+More detail on map than the regular fenix 7.<br />+battery is like around 2 weeks if I don't realy use the recording.<br />+convenient to have a map on your wrist, grant it is a tad small.<br />+tell me I have low Vo2.<br />+can monitor your sleep pattern, rem, deep sleep, etc.<br />+I was on the east coast and now back on the west coast and I didn't even have to adjust the time.  Not sure If I had to adjust the daylight either.<br />+like google smartwatch it can send you alert on your screen.<br />+battery is great, since it has solar and doesn't have the bright and vivid oled screen of garmin epic.  ( I bought mine instore and was able to compare both)  I prefer the longer battery life.  My smartphone can be fore more detail items.<br />+alot of good info, temp, alt, sun set heart rate you can see on the fly.<br />+touch screen works very well.<br /><br />neutrals:<br />*has a flashlight led, I don't use it much.  Actually I hard every use it.<br />*good little vibrate when you get alert.<br />*this is music and wallet stuff I also don't use.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-cost<br />-while the map is good, I might want a bigger cycling map later.<br />-compared to the garmin epic which has a  brighter screen, this one isn't as bright, Seem reflect light so you can see even at night but not very bright.<br />-it is quit dim at times<br /><br />I want to get the base model but looking at this at the store, i wanted the bigger screen, the solar power and sapphire.  I scratched my watch from just bumping into things so anything less than sapphire is a no go.  Is still might end up buying a cycling gps map, but this is good enough for now.  price is just way too high when they add one feature over the next model for 100 more.",

The problem with charging that (and this) smart watch is the fact that you can't just plug them in anywhere with a regular micro usb.  They have their proprietary charging \"cradle\" that gloms onto the back of the watch.  This one seem so far to have a higher battery life without having to shut down every app to extend the battery life.  The only thing I would wish is that if they market these to both men and women, MAKE THE WATCH FACE A BIT SMALLER!!!  I understand about seeing/reading everything on the watch, but JEEZ it is HUGE!!!  I had to fasten it further down on my wrist/arm so the watch face fit my arm.  I'm not a tiny woman nor am I a big one, so if that's a problem for an average woman, please take note and scale it back by about 3%.  Otherwise, this is a great smart watch.

        "text": "I got this watch for my husband who is 6'3. This watch fits his wrist really well. He has used this for over a month before the review.<br /><br />CONS (very minor):<br />1. If you move your hand the right way it can hit the buttons on the side and start apps by accident<br />2. It can be sensitive when moving your hand around and turn on the clock display/run down the battery faster<br />3. I don't like that the charger is so specific. It would be nice to be able to have more than 1 option to charge<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Battery Life: Easily lasts 1.5 days before charging and it was fine. If it runs down really low it will automatically go into battery saving mode and only functions as a normal watch. It charges very quickly<br />2. Style: It looks nice. The face size is a good size and easy to read. The band is silicone, comfortable and holds up well to a lot of use. My husband has received many compliments on it. You can change the clock face to a few different options and customize it to you.<br />3. Alerts: When you get notifications of a message or call the watch vibrates. The watch has a microphone but no speakers so you cannot have a phone call through it or play music. You can type a message or even do a voice to text using the watch.<br />4. Calendar: The calendar function is nice and gives notifications for upcoming events. It makes it nice when he is in a meeting especially<br />5. Exercise: It took a while to figure out, but the exercise tracking is nice. My husband doesn't run but does like to lift weights and do other exercise. He was even able to calibrate the watch and it will count his reps for him. It also tracks heart rate, which you can set to track throughout the day. It also tracks steps.<br />6. GPS: The watch has a GPS and map function. You can see where you are and toggle the maps around to see routes around you. You can also set up multiple route paths ahead if you run/bike etc.<br />7. Durability: My husband swam with it in a saltwater pool and had no issues, it is definitely water safe. He has hit it accidentally on a few corners/desks and the glass has held up really well, no scratches. The touch sensitivity is great, easy to control but not OVERLY sensitive.<br /><br />Overall it is a great watch!",

BUT here are the SERIOUS flaws so far:<br /><br />-The Blood Pressure monitor is a COMPLETE JOKE. \"Inaccurate\" is NOT the word. I tried it on several friends and coworkers. Garbage!<br />-You are supposed to be able to make a gesture of bringing your wrist up to view the watch and then it is supposed to turn the screen on so that you can read it. ALMOST NEVER! No matter HOW I make the gesture the only thing that works is a PAINFUL twist/shake of my wrist and then it's not guaranteed. I just use the button instead which kind of defeats the purpose.<br />-BUT THEN, when sleeping.... EVERY DAMNED MOVEMENT I MAKE it turns on... and waking up my wife, because it is like having a flashlight shone in your face!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />So... EVEN THOUGH this was only $20...

        "text": "The blue silicone band was too small to go around my wrist. I called Skagen and they offered to sell me a bigger band. I told them I shouldn't have to pay extra for the watch to go on my wrist. They said since I bought it from Amazon there was nothing they could do. So sadly, this is getting returned.<br />I've worn plenty of watches before, and I don't have a fatty wrist. My wrist is 8 inches in circumference, which is average for a male.<br />The interesting thing about the size as I inspected and measured the watch, is that if you measure the watch laid out flat, 8 inches goes to the second to last notch, and it should fit fine. BUT -- the watch body itself obviously does not bend, which means in actual wear when the watch goes AROUND your wrist, you need an additional 3/4 to 1 inch for it to work.<br />It's basically like that one gallon jug I bought at Walmart, I got it home to make a drink mix in it just to realize that yes, it held one gallon, if you filled it to the absolute brim, at which point putting in the drink mix made it spill.<br />If your wrist is greater than 7 inches in circumference, I would not buy this watch.",

        "text": "I got Moto 360 several years ago when smart watches first came out and it was nice, but annoying.  It was tied into everything and kept giving me alerts and so eventually I got tired of it.  My wife also had a first generation Samsung Gear watch and that was about the same as the Moto.<br />Well, fast forward a few years and now my wife, daughter, son and daughter-in-law all have newer smart watches (Apple Watches and Fitbit) and they all love them.  It was time to get a new phone, so I got a Samsung  S20 FE and then decided to get the Samsung watch.  I saw on the reviews that it really works well with Samsung phones and so I decided to get the Watch 3.  I was looking at the Watch 2, which had a few less features and then I found the Watch 3 in the 41mm size and then found a refurbished one so I ended up paying about the same for the Watch 3 as I would have for the Watch 2.<br />I'm very impressed with the watch and really love it.  I didn't get the one with a cell phone, it just connects to my phone with bluetooth and/or wifi, but it's really amazing.  I get my messages, and can turn off the ones that I don't want and then I also get all the health apps.  So, now it tells me to get off my chair and walk around and does EKG and stress tesing and Oxygen levels..<br />I was concerned that the 41 mm might be too small, but it is a great size for me as you can see from the pic.  I have had a Citizen Echo Drive for more than 10 years and it is a little larger, but I like the size of the Watch 3 better.<br />If you are thinking about getting a watch, this one is a good deal right now and I believe it does work best if you use it with a Samsung phone.",

How???, you only have five watch faces at any given time but you can only replace one of the five - the others are permanently set, you get to edit the fourth one by adding a photo<br /><br />Overall, there are cheaper and better watches like the WYZE (which I own and has better quality) but lack the phone answering and dialing features.<br /><br />I will be replacing the strap with another type to see if it holds.",

        "text": "I have been wearing this for a solid 4 months, using it to track dives, swimming, running, walking, treadmill workouts, etc. In watch mode the battery lasts a long time, but for activities you will find yourself charging it after about 5-8 hours of activity use.<br /><br />I was a bit worried my skin would react as I cannot usually wear anything metal unless high quality gold or sterling silver. No problems with this watch - the band is comfortable and the watch, while a bit larger than I was used to, fits well and without any reaction.<br /><br />Functions while diving were flawless. You have a lot of parameter's you can set - this thing is designed for divers. It tracks entry and exit locations accurately. I wish I could tell it when my dive is starting and when done, the automatic feature is a bit annoying in this regard. However, it is one less thing to remember when you are in the water and doing a buddy check to get going. It is pretty neat to how nicely it updates the app on your phone and makes sharing easy.<br /><br />Pool swimming is not entirely accurate - the watch cannot record kickboard laps, for example, so if you like to vary your workout you won't have accurate times or distances. Basically, any time you are not completing actual strokes you won't get a record.<br /><br />Treadmill work - you can adjust the settings to match your treadmill readings. I found it was not very accurate and finally quit bothering to adjust it. The watch was either lower in distance or higher every time, but close enough to just let it be. At least once you leave it alone you get consistent numbers, and you can also record numbers from the treadmill if you want.<br /><br />Walking and trail running features are great - I love seeing where I was with the GPS integration. I work out regularly on a measured trail and the distances are spot-on with the MK2S. There are workouts it will suggest, but I tend to stick to my own and ignore those. I was really frustrated to find my VO2 was consistently \"Poor\" all fall, but have seen some improvement recently with regular workouts. Kind of cool getting readings like that.<br /><br />I plan to use this watch for backpacking as well - I have not had an opportunity to test it since the purchase, but my last trip my sister had a different model and it worked well other than eating power. You absolutely have to carry one or two good battery packs to charge it. I really wish this had a solar option, which I understand is in future plans, so I will more than likely upgrade when that is offered. Even so, hiking puts your wrist in the shade a lot of the time unless you are hiking alpine locations, so not sure how well solar would actually work.<br /><br />All said, I love my \"toy\". It helps keep me motivated when I see I have been in the office too long or my scores are a lot lower. I am competitive and happy to compete against myself, so it works well. I don't use the connections, although I have considered seeing if anyone I know has a Garmin, but so far its all me :D While pricy, for someone who loves a wide variety of athletic activity, you can't beat the Garmin Mk2 in any of its versions. My husband is still trying to decide if he wants the Mk2S or the Mk2i but he will be getting one or the other. Fantastic product.",

        "text": "Like - was able to call and receive texts. Was able to answer a call on the watch. Pairing was easy. The app was easy.<br />Dislike - Once paired, the watch takes all your media volume away from your phone. You won't hear any music like from YouTube, text message alert or phone ringing. The watch has a little vibration that you can barely feel, when you receive a text or getting a phone call. All sounds like from Facebook videos or anything, goes through the watch. The only way I could find to get it to quit doing this, was to unpair the watch totally. I need military time but couldn't find a way to make the time in a 24 hour format. You have to put the watch together. The bands come apart from the watch. Everytime you move your hand the watch face lights up. This was definitely not what I was looking for at all. Would I buy this again? No.",

        "text": "I have so many feelings about this watch. First off, set up was a breeze. You just open your app store and get the Google app directed. Pairing and synching up your info is very easy. The watch is very beautiful! I was scared the crystals would rub right off like glitter, but I have not had any issues so far. Now for all the bad stuff.. first and foremost the battery life is terrible. I would give it 9-10 hours max. I'm not much of an app person either, so if you are then that means your battery life will be even lower. It has its own charger, so that means you'll have to carry it around with you, especially big your planning to go out after work or school which is very inconvenient. I with it was a standard C USB charger so I can just use my phone charger, but sadly that's not the case. I did an experiment to see how long the battery would last. I charged it to 100%, and left it in my desk right before bed. In the morning at 8 am, I am at 15%. Whoa. Yeah, the battery is just really really terrible. So I thought I'd just change the battery settings..well there is only one other option and that is to go into battery saving mode where all it will display is the time. That in my opinion defeats the purpose of a smart watch. Other than that, I love how I can customize watch faces by using my social media, or pick from a pre made list by Michael Kors. You can also get email notifications, download apps like Google keep to take notes by speaking into your watch, as well as use Google pay, activity tracker, weather, and pause and play music without taking out your phone. So yeah, if your okay with a short battery life, then everything else about this watch is awesome. Just giving you the real tea. Hope you found this review helpful.",

        "text": "I was skeptical about purchasing this combo because of the cheap price and the sketchy reviews, but I'll admit I'm impressed. I only spent $22.50 for the entire combo (used/refurbished). I expected the mouse to be dirt cheap from what the reviews were saying, but it feels quite solid to me. I played some Boarderlands and some League of Legends on the combo last night and it was comfortable and they both held up well. The mouse has a dpi changer that works great. For me personally I think it may have too many modes (somewhere around 4 or 5). I personally just like having 2 or 3 because when you're in game it gets complicated to remember which dpi setting you are on and cycle through to the correct one all within a few seconds.<br /><br />They keyboard isn't overly bright. It is kind of is hard to read the keys at an angle, but other than that, it seems to be a great keyboard so far.<br /><br />This is a good buy, for the low price of $20-30, for a basic gamin setup.<br /><br />Typing is also decently comfortable, just takes some getting used to since I am used to flat keys.",

        "title": "Amazing gaming & multitasking keyboard \u2013 improved my gaming and my everyday typing.",
        "text": "I purchased this keyboard to go with my first custom-built gaming rig that I built around 2 months ago. I had been getting so frustrated with my old standard Logitech keyboard and I wanted an upgrade. I am not new to gaming, but this was my first \u2018serious\u2019 build, so I went with the advice of many of my more experienced friends and purchased a mechanical keyboard.<br /><br />I needed a keyboard that could multitask as well. I work as a web developer, and I am in grad school for marketing \u2013 I do a lot of typing. So I wanted something that was going to last and perform in all of these uses \u2013 and still improve my gaming experience. After doing a TINY bit of keyboard research, I chose the blue switches since I do a lot more \u201cregular typing\u201d than gaming.<br /><br />I\u2019ve had the keyboard for about 2 days, and in that time I\u2019ve used it to play the DOOM Multiplayer Beta, and several hours of Fallout 4. So far this morning I\u2019ve written 2 blog posts, one paper, and now this review :D.<br /><br />My first impression of this product was it was HEAVY. Not in a bad way, just in a very sturdy was that was a sharp contrast to what I had had before in my standard keyboard. Since this is a desktop keyboard, there\u2019s no need for this keyboard to be light. The other thing I noticed was the high quality braided USB cable. I must\u2019ve missed that feature when I ordered because I was pleasantly surprised \u2013 the USB connector is also gold plated. I did not expect that for such a low price point of around $100. (Note: I did receive a discount on the product in exchange for my honest review.)<br /><br />I also received this keyboard exceptionally fast. I ordered on a Thursday afternoon and got it Saturday morning \u2013 no Saturday delivery fee!<br /><br />**Important** So the package comes with a guide that is very concise \u2013 pay attention! I got confused when I didn\u2019t get a \u2018new hardware found\u2019 notification like the manual said. However, the rest of the instructions worked fine, so it must not have mattered. I\u2019m on Windows 10.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that the shortcut keys (like for volume and track control) worked without any software at all. To access the different light settings, you just press FN and select the pattern from the keyboard itself. I settled on FN+0 \u2013 It\u2019s a responsive setting that lights up the keys you type and then lets them fade \u2013 very cool since I don\u2019t want to have the keyboard lit all the time. I\u2019ll admit though \u2013 this thing is pretty, when I leave my desk I\u2019ve been quickly pressing FN+Ins to get it to do the wave effect if I\u2019m gonna be away for a while.<br /><br />So that\u2019s just the extra stuff \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the performance. I can without a doubt say this keyboard has made a difference in my playing. The game mode is essential \u2013 make sure you enable that when you launch a game. The DOOM multiplayer beta was probably a bad gauge since that game is ridiculously hard anyway \u2013 but I noticed a marked difference in my performance on Fallout 4. I\u2019m not going to pretend to be a keyboard expert, all I can say is that the response time was way better.<br /><br />And I am SO glad I went with blue switches. Writing papers, I feel like an old world typist \u2013 the mechanical and audible feedback I get from typing is so satisfying. I have noticed reduced typos from \u2018accidental\u2019 slips. The audible click sound doesn\u2019t really sound like the bulky old keyboards, it\u2019s more of a quick, clean clicking. It isn\u2019t loud, but it\u2019s NOT whisper quiet, which I prefer.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The rubber feet keep it in place on my desk (I am one of those crazy people who don\u2019t use a slide-out keyboard tray).<br />- The keyboard is study, and well made. A great value for the money.<br />- No special software needed to change effects and settings, everything is controlled on the keyboard, and the instructions are only 1 page.<br />- The game features are useful! Locking the windows key, consecutive attack mode.<br />- Custom patterns \u2013 this is essential when gaming. I used it to highlight the keys used when playing.<br />- Excellent physical and audible feedback when typing \u2013 extremely satisfying.<br />- The confidence that comes with the 50 million actuation lifecycle (I type a LOT)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There weren\u2019t any instructions on what to do if you never got the \u2018new hardware found\u2019 message when plugging in the keyboard. This confused me ' but I figured it out. If this happens to you \u2013 just proceed with the manual, as far as I can tell, it makes no difference.<br />- As far as I can tell, you can\u2019t make ALL the keys light up one color. I might be overlooking something though. This might be a con for some.<br /><br />I would say this keyboard is perfect for someone like me who wants a serious gaming keyboard, but is ultimately a multitasker. You will definitely notice a difference if switching from a non-mechanical keyboard.<br />The quality of this keyboard has me anxious to try other GAMDIAS products, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an upgrade!",

Just a word of warning for anyone pairing this cable with a Drop Alt (or maybe any other Drop keyboard).<br /><br />This is the third coiled cable I have ordered, and it's definitely the best quality overall.  The cable itself is thick and good quality.  The coil is a bit firm, but nothing too unusual.  The intermediate connector is all metal and heavy.  Both sides of the intermediate connector can be unthreaded:  The side going to the USB-C connector, and the side going to the USB connector.<br /><br />One interesting thing I noticed was that the end connectors have a color matched almost shrink wrap thickness strain protection around them.  The USB side is the most noticeable, and the USB-C side is a bit thicker.  As long as there is enough strain protection, I actually prefer the less bulky end connections.<br /><br />The only nit is the color.  Even though it looked dark purplish in the product listing, I was hoping that it would be more blue in real life.  It's not, it's an attractive dark purple.  I would assume the color represented in the product listing is accurate, in case you're wondering if there is any color variation from the listing photos to real life.",

        "text": "I previously got a tactile switch sampler set and honestly loved the AJAZZ Banana more than U4 Boba and its other iterations. I liked these more than Glorious Panda and Holy Panda. I type a lot as a student, so I didn't want anything too heavy--it gets tiring. I've been using AJAZZ Banana for two days so far now and I LOVE it!<br /><br />I was using lubed Gateron browns before. I wanted something punchier but not too heavy. Banana is the perfect answer to that. Actuation force is about the same to Gat browns. I have a north-facing RGB board and the lights come through Banana switches beautifully.<br /><br />In answer to the other reviewer, I believe that the Banana switches ARE lubed (with what, I don't know). I have a stock/un-lubed AJAZZ Banana switch from my switch sampler pack, these pre-lubed ones feel slightly lighter in comparison. Out of the box, these feel great without additional lubing. Results will vary depending on your mech keeb setup.<br /><br />Note that the switch pack comes with 46 switches, so it won't be enough to do a full board. I have a 60% board and had enough to do the alphanumeric keys and other frequently pressed keys like Shift, Enter, Ctrl, Backspace, Alt, Tab, and punctuation keys. I left my Gat browns on the less frequent keys. I have two \"extra\" Banana switches as backups.<br /><br />Highly recommend. If you want tactile but not heavy, this is a very affordable option.",

        "text": "[[VIDEOID:dff950435419a7006b0295e50b846c44]] This review is for the Ajazz Diced Fruit Banana Switch.<br />I wanted to try these switches compared to a brown switch because of its similar characteristics.<br />These Banana switches are definitely tactile and smooth.  They do have a tactile click sound and require a bit more force to actuate (not really noticeable for me because I'm heavy handed and I bottom out the key when I type).  I'm not going to mention specs such as actuation force and distance because you can find that info in the product description or manufacturer's site.<br />I will talk about the \"feeling\" of these switches though because in everyday use, gaming and office work, I'm not thinking about the actuation force/distance, etc.  For me it is how it feels and sounds.<br /><br />So first off, these are excellent switches, no doubt. It is then just a matter of personal preference whether or not you like the characteristics of the Banana switch.  For me, it is a bit too noisy.  The tactile bump feels good but after using the Banana's for a while, I would hate typing while on mic because the mic picks up the keystrokes loud and clear and can be annoying for others to hear.  I don't have blue switches to compare these Bananas to but I would imagine the blue switches would be worse in sound.  I do have red switches to compare and the reds are noticeably quieter, I think mainly due to being linear (no tactile bump).  For me and personal preference and usage, I would stick with the reds.<br /><br />If you like tactile switches and are currently using a different tactile switch, I'd urge you give these Banana switches a try.  See my video review where I installed these switches into a keyboard and compare to red switches, so you can get an idea of the sound when the switches are installed into a keyboard frame with keycaps on.  In the video I have mistakenly called the red switches Gaterons, but I'm pretty sure they are Kailh reds with box stem.",

        "text": "I love tactile switches, so when this was offered for review I figured I'd give it a shot as I'd heard good things about Ajazz switches.  It arrived and I swapped out the switches in my NK65 (DROP Holy Pandas) and threw these into the alphas.<br /><br />In terms of feel they're a pretty strong tactile.  I felt it important to mention that I was using HP's above because these feel very similar to those, just with a lighter spring.  The bump is close to identical which is nice, and I prefer the lighter spring as I've been mainlining my Niz lately with 35g switches, so light is my thing right now.  In terms of sound, the housing does make these quite a bit higher pitch than HP's, and I'd honestly put it in line with some Akko tactiles.  Not too high to not enjoy, but higher than I'm initially used to.<br /><br />Because these come pre-lubed they can be used stock, which is nice because while once I start I find lubing switches to be relaxing, but it's an activity I dread until I'm actually going.  Just something about it seems beyond tedious, and to be fair, it is.  Thankfully the lube job on these is pretty good and there's no ping to be heard or scratchiness to be felt.  I did lube one just to see the difference that one done by hand can make, and the job on these is good enough that it makes no difference.  The switch is fine as-is.<br /><br />Other than being plate mount only I can't find a problem with these.  The spring weight is nice and they sound and feel great to type on.  I'm thinking about grabbing another set to build out a board with them in the future.",

So it was essentially wired, while I prefer the wireless aesthetic.<br /><br />This one avoids the backlight killing the battery life as well as internal battery degradation. I can see the key labels fine without a backlight, and it takes replaceable batteries. Battery life should be months without the backlight, and it even has a low battery warning light. No cord to deal with.<br /><br />Seems well built, heavy, and doesn\u2019t slide on the desk. Nice price point. Easy to set up. It even has multiple tilt angle (height) options, although I like it flat.

        "text": "I am not lying: This is hands down the best keyboard for writing I have used in the last twenty years. I liked the older acrylic Apple keyboard and I own a mechanical keyboard with click-switches (blue), but this one makes touch typing so much more comfortable.<br />I wasn\u2019t sure if I would like the tactile keys without click, because I actually like the click. They are just very loud. Logitech\u2019s K845 (with Cherry MX red) is a great keyboard as well, but louder and has a cable.<br />I wish this keyboard would be backlit though. Black keyboards in front of big screens need some sort of illumination. I got one of these USB LED lights that I plugged behind my monitor, that half-solves the problem by providing some backlight.<br />Still it\u2019s awesome to write on it. It\u2019s focus is to be a mechanical keyboard. So much that it seems that it skipped the product design. It looks like an OEM-Keyboard from 1995. That\u2019s in a way uncompromisingly functional, but next to a modern flat butterfly keyboard it looks like someone parked an old Volvo next to a Miata.<br />The quality is good. The keycaps are heavy and lettering sharp. It might be confusing for some that the \u2018upper\u2019 characters are printed next to the main set in the same size.<br />Battery life seems not to be a problem. I am pretty much writing all day, and I\u2019m still on the first set of batteries that came in the package.<br />PROS AND CONS<br />+ Precise keyboard for touch-typing<br />+ Quiet enough for shared work areas<br />+ Height adjustable<br />+ Great quality<br />+ Long Battery life<br />+ Connects via dongle, not Bluetooth (yes, for me that\u2019s a pro. Bluetooth sucks)<br />+ Compact with no number pad<br /><br />- Chunky design<br />- No backlight<br />- Very heavy<br />- Vague keycap lettering<br />- No number pad (*conflict*)<br />I can recommend this keyboard to anyone who is typing over a long amount of times. It takes a while to get used to, but once adjusted it\u2019s less tiring than modern butterfly or rubber cap keyboards, because the keys don\u2019t bottom out that easily, and feel better to the fingertips. I took a few photos. I hope it helps to make a decision.",

And while an old-school touch typist might miss the \u201cclick\u201d feedback of a mechanical keyboard, these keys have decent travel, so if you are typing, you will have little doubt that you have actually engaged the key. (I can\u2019t talk to gaming with these.)<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the bluetooth connection, nor the responsiveness while typing.<br /><br />If I have any reliability issues, I will be sure to revisit this review as necessary.",

        "text": "I bought these keycaps for a cheap mechanical keyboard I had lying around. I had put some cheap keycaps of a similar price but a different brand on them earlier this year. Didn't like those keycaps at all.<br /><br />These keycaps have a more pleasant texture, not smooth but not quite as grainy. I love love love the greyscale color scheme, and the blank keycaps are really aesthetically pleasing. Obviously, if you can't type without looking at your keyboard you should purchase the keycaps that come with all the lettering, it probably won't take away much from your experience.<br /><br />One small note, I would suggest caution when using the included keycap puller. It scratched the side of my spacebar and left a little black line. Unfortunately, it is on the side of the keyboard that faces me, so now every time I sit down to type I will see the little black scratch. So be careful when pulling these off. Otherwise, I love these colors and will definitely consider buying other products from this brand based on this level of quality for price.<br /><br />I forgot to mention. I loved the packaging on these keycaps!! The other brand I bought from had the keycaps all together in a ziplock bag. This brand had the keycaps arranged in order in sleeves and it was so much better for putting the keycaps on! ok that's all.",

We take a premium \u2013 Cherry or similar \u2013 keyboard and remove all or most of the key tops replacing them with the various colors available making a color complementary computer input device. It makes for a more interesting keyboard, which obviously is the main interface with your computer, and it gives our customers something so unique as to be one-of-a-kind. All the keyboards start with premium red, blue, brown, or black key actuators which, without exception, are the best available. That together with our customer\u2019s keytops \u201cartwork\u201d gives a person something exclusive as well as offering superior functionality. The keytops come right off use the small plastic tool most of the keytop provides include with their kits and doing a whole keyboard only takes about 20 minutes. One thing you do have to watch for is the keytop height. Many times, they will make certain keys a little higher. This poses no issue unless you stick a high key in the middle of the number/letters, then this may impede faster typists. Remember each key actuator that is attached to the base of the keyboard is programmed to send a certain signal to the computer thus causing your monitor to display that letter/number or take that action. For example, if you put the \u201cM\u201d keytop where the \u201cT\u201d was that will still send a \u201cT\u201d to your computer and monitor. I would recommend removing and replacing 2 or 3 at a time or having a like keyboard to refer to, so the possibility for confusion is limited. All keyboards don\u2019t have the exact layout especially in the extended section and number pad. Also, some of the higher end gaming style keyboards have extra programmable keys that are specified through the keyboard manufacturer\u2019s software. Some of the keytop set will provide blank keys to use in these instances. Buy a couple sets and have fun making your own custom keyboard.",

        "text": "The keyboard is very visually appealing. I do not know if my lack of keyboard knowledge is why I give this 4/5 stars, but there are a few features I do not like. Starting with the positives, the backlight (light blue not changeable) is very appealing and not hard on the eyes, the swappable red switches are nice because I like red, and the linear red switches mean it has a nice click noise when typing. Moving into the cons, there is a bit that is annoying. The most notable, and would probably lower the rating more if I wasn't nice, is the spring noises from the keys. There is a buzzing noise that is left if a key is tapped too hard. This can be fixed by buying lube, but annoying nonetheless. Another feature is the lack of hotkey commands. I write a bit of papers and I usually have multiple tabs open. Trying to hotkey a tab to the left or right side of my screen doesn't work because to use arrow keys, the fn key needs to be held and that doesn't work for the windows hotkey: win+arrow_key. Another annoying hotkey feature is the 'del' key which is fn+n. The n key is in a bit of a bad spot to use the 'delete'' function. Of course, these can all be changed by editing the layers of the keyboard, but it is a long and annoying process that I have not taken the time to do yet. The last issue is the key colors. At night, seeing the gray keys, with the backlight on, is a bit difficult. The second photo attached also has extra keys added, not all of them can be attached to the keyboard because there isn't a spot for it (a bit weird but ok).<br /><br />Pros:<br />nice backlight (not changeable color)<br />clacking linear red switches<br />extra switch colors<br /><br />Cons:<br />Spring noise<br />keyboard's default button layer<br />hard to see switches at night",

In the box was the full-size white keyboard, detachable USB cord, keycap remover, and manual.<br /><br />Setup was plug and play, no additional drivers needed for Windows 11. The keyboard replaced my 105 key Cherry Blue switch manual black keyboard... which has worked very well with just basic cleaning for 5 years. Compared to my old keyboard this keyboard adds multi color, and some very intense graphics, should you choose to use them... I see videos already posted for this product cycling thru the graphics available so I will just show pictures of the static color I have chosen.<br /><br />The Red Optical/Manual switches on this keyboard are a little quieter than the blue cherry switches I am used to \u2013 but they are by no means quiet\u2026it definitely has the tap, tap, tap sound inherent in all manual keyboards The press seems very easy... much lighter and easier than the blue manual switches I am used to. And so far, I think I prefer the red optical/manual switches on this keyboard. Of course, typing is very subjective to taste and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Overall, I can honestly say that I approve of this keyboard, and will keep this one as my everyday keyboard, unless, of course my wife steals it for her home office workstation\u2026 she has after all been eyeballing it.",

The keys feel really good  when gaming, the input is instantaneous and the feel and travel is really smooth. The only downside for me it is that it is very loud. I use this when my wife is around and she is immediately annoyed, lol, so I only use it when I game on my own. That being said, this is my favorite keyboard. I love all the RGB patterns, (check video). I love the feel of the keys, when I game I feel that is just the right travel distance and feel for my taste. The rear pop out legs help me put this bad boy at the right angle. The finish is really even and dark, the keys are not your typical white on black, it is more of a clear or light grey, this makes the contrast a little harder to see what key is what, so if you don't type well and need to reference the keyboard visually it might be a harder to see.  All in all this is a very good entry level keyboard and it is very budget friendly.<br /><br />+ RGB Great patterns<br />+ Hefty and stable<br />+ Silky smooth keys<br />+ USB-C braded cable<br />+ Mac / Win compatible<br />+ Black finish is matte and clean<br />- Loud Keys<br /><br />Hope this was helpful!",

These keys have the same build quality and sound as the Kinetic Labs set at almost 1/3 of the price.<br /><br />I'm not an expert but I did take a picture of the spacebars and it does appear that the blue version may be warped slightly or disfigured, I don't know. I took the picture incase it helped. Outside of that, to my untrained eye everything else looked perfect. Gorgeous set.<br /><br />I liked the options this seller had in other keycap sets, so I used this set as a trial run and was not disappointed. I will be looking to order other colors in the future.",

The wired option works well, too.<br /><br />I didn't love the keycaps and replaced them right away with some that I already had, which are more smooth and have a broader key surface. That's a personal preference thing, though.<br /><br />I've never used clear switches and was excited to give them a try. I usually use red switches, and found the clear switches to be very comfortable. They offer more resistance and shorter travel than red switches. Once I switched to lower profile key caps, I found the noise level to be slightly quieter as well. There is a bit of spring squeak when typing, though. There are also no feet on the keyboard to adjust the height/angle of your typing surface.<br /><br />Only three of the switches can be removed, though I cannot figure out why you would... It removes functionality (why would you want a page up key, but not page down?). The only reason to do this that I could think of was to more distinctly isolate the arrow keys for gaming.<br /><br />The keyboard came with a keycap puller and I was able to replace all of the caps without too much trouble.

The build quality is similar to your run of the mill gk61 or sk61, so it's a plastic tray mount case with an some kind of metal plate not sure if it's steel or aluminum. The board isn't hotswap aside from 3 keys in the nav cluster on the right side of the board that can be covered with a plastic plate. I personally think Ganss was really brave to offer Cherry MX Clears as an option as those bottom out at nearly 100g but I'm here for it. The acoustics of the board are pretty bad this thing is loud and I would not recommend it for an office environment unless you really hate your coworkers. The stabilizers were sufficiently lubed and fit well in the plate so they didn't rattle. The keycaps seem like a cheap dye sub set and weren't terrible. The board lacks any kind of backlighting which I find strange as it has north facing switches which is usually the reason to have them that way otherwise they can interference with row 3 of cherry profile keycaps. The board has Bluetooth but doesn't have a rechargeable battery included, just 2 AAA Duracell batteries which I will give them credit for as Duracell is a good brand. Overall the board doesn't really do anything to justify it's steep price point there are much better boards in it's price range that include better switches, backlighting, and way better acoustics.",

        "text": "This super-compact mechanical keyboard has a solid feel for a plastic keyboard at this price point. The travel and build quality of the keys feel great, and as expected for MX Clears (which are softer than other Cherry MX switches I have used). Having a detachable USB-C cable plus wireless is the best of all worlds for connectivity and long-term usability, and should be the standard for all keyboards moving forward.<br /><br />I prefer a larger footprint for my daily driver, but this is a great keyboard if you need portability or work in a small space, and still want the benefits of Cherry MX switches.<br /><br />n.b. The keyboard is not backlit, which increased battery life, but definitely reduces its \"gamer chic\" vibe.",

        "text": "Note: I chose the Grey/Beige set. This set (YMDK 96 84 ANSI ISO Key) went on just fine, and are a great frugal find.<br /><br />I bought these for an relatively inexpensive TKL mechanical wireless keyboard (RK87G) because the OEM keycaps were set in a truly fugly and illegible typeface.<br /><br />These YMDKs feel good, and have a slightly deeper \"thunk\" when they bottom out. The two-character keys are typeset vertically, as Underwood and Remington intended. Although the font size on most of the keys is a big, they are fine and give the keyboard a bit of a homemade retro look.<br /><br />NOTE Specific to the RK87G: This YMDK set does not have a ScrlLk key.  The right Shift and right CTRL on this set are a little too small, so I just left the old ones on. I also left the OEM ScrlLk, Page Up, and arrow keys on because they have symbols for controlling the RGB LEDs. If you use the RKs function keys for app and control shortcuts, you may want to leave those on as well.<br /><br />May 30, 2021<br />I've had these for a little over six months now. Still a great value set the money. I installed them on a keyboard I use for hours on end nearly every day. The printing on the beige keys hasn't faded, but I've noticed that the grey keys with white printing are beginning to fade. I'm not taking any stars off because before I purchased these I had already read other reviewers who had the same experience.",

It's been a couple of months since I got this keyboard, and I love it.  I love the form factor, I love the feel typing with it.  Excellent for gaming.  But with all that said, there is one annoying thing that warrants it to get 3 stars... the RGB lighting.<br /><br />I got this plugged in to my 43 inch Aorus gaming monitor's KVM.  When I work, this keyboard controls my work laptop, and when I game it controls my gaming PC via KVM.  The RGB works fine on both computers, but when the computers goes to sleep and/or the screen turns off, the RGB also turns off.  It's fine when it turns on when I wake up the computers, but majority of the time the RGB lights won't come back on from sleep, and that is annoying.  When I manually lock the desktop, the RGB lights on the keyboard turns off, but when I unlock the desktop, the RGB lights won't turn on also.  I thought something may be wrong with the KVM, but I tested the KVM using my Keychron keyboards, and they work fine, which means nothing is wrong with the KVM of the monitor.  In order for the lights to work again, I have to unplug and re-plug the USB cable.  It does the same thing even when in wireless mode.<br /><br />I honestly like this keyboard when the RGB lights are working, and right now just keep on checking if there are new firmware for this keyboard everyday hoping that the annoying sleep bug will be fixed.  So, 3 stars for now.",

        "text": "Works great. Anyone looking at this keyboard already knows what it is and what it can do. I've heard it is a little more expensive than other brands that are doing the same thing. I don't know or care. I wanted this one, this brand. It's been flawless since purchase. - older review<br /><br />8/26/22 - Update<br />Original keyboard is still working flawless since purchase. This keyboard has been working so well that I actually ended up buying a second one! I jump between multi-devices daily. Running the USB-C (charging cable) to one device and placing the Bluetooth dongle in another allows you to easily switch between them. You could very well run a USB-C cable to all your devices using color coded cables with some cable management have a USB-C (fountain like) connected to your desk and rotate through the cables to match the desired device.<br /><br />This keyboard runs flawless on every device I have associated it with. Zero issues in regard to connectivity: brands, operating systems, etc.<br /><br />Have to keep in mind that the heart of this keyboard is gaming. Very fast and instant with zero noticeable latency & lag. Wired - Bluetooth you will not be able to tell the difference. Large hands might get a little cramped. I've learned to work through it. The pros outweigh the cons. The only cons I can think that others would consider as such, would be the size and price. But you can't really fault it for that and here is why. 1) It's a 60-65% keyboard and you knew this prior of purchase. You can't fault it for what it is and its targeted users. i.e. \"Well, it's not as comfortable on the arthritis as a full-size split keyboard\" - duh... 2) You get what you pay for. There are more expensive kb's as well as cheaper. Rog Falchion sits nestled in the lower mid-range tier on pricing. Blue Clicky are on sale for $99.99 and the Red Linear are $129.99. That is a very fair price considering what is packaged.<br /><br />Rog software is not the best but isn't the worst either. I have had a lot more issues with my Logitech software in comparison to what has basically been a stress-free experience with Rog. The software is not technically required to use the kb. If you want to make customizations such as changing the kb color, etc. You will have to download it. There are stock functions (modes) built-in that may suffice enough for some users or turn the RGB completely off to utilize maximum battery life. ** Side note, I'm rarely ever in a need to charge it. I leave RGB on at all times. I've left it on overnight, etc. The physical need to charge in order for me to use it is so far and few in-between that it feels like a chargeless keyboard. If you use a USB-C to connect to another device the Keyboard will charge while doing so.<br /><br />Mine has been pretty damn resilient too. I have unintentionally knocked/thrown this keyboard via airborne a few times from my working area onto vinyl flooring. Besides a few small scratches on the case, little harm was done each time.<br /><br />So, what do we have here?<br /><br />We have a mechanical keyboard with MX Cherries. One has Red Linear switches and the other Blue Clicky.<br /><br />I prefer the Blue Clicky!!! This keyboard is oh, so satisfying.<br /><br />Yes, they are loud - oh no! However, no one cares. You don't purchase mechanical keyboards while pretending to be an office ninja. That is why I prefer the Blue Clicky over the Red linear.<br /><br />The Red linear knows it's loud but tries to be quiet while at a higher cost. It delivers what feels like a finger-press to the depths of the Mariana Trench with an awkward/muffled low-toned like sound to match the embarrassment it is hiding from.<br /><br />The Blue Clicky fully embraces its true self while doing so at a lower cost. It delivers a more satisfying user experience with touch and sound. Each key press has an instant-mechanical-click. Letting you know, \"Hey I am here!\" Delivering the sound and feeling of reaching the finish line with each finger press.<br /><br />Overall - It is a wonderful keyboard. The Falchion will never make you feel like you wish it had more abilities. It will only make you feel like you want more of its capabilities. - Hints me buying two<br /><br />Regardless of your switch preference you can't go wrong with this purchase.",

The keys feel good to type on when used with a clicky or linear switch. They are a bit heavy, so a lighter switch wouldn't be a bad option.

Colors are accurate and legends are clear. No complaints there.<br /><br />My one gripe is the XVX profile. It takes a lot of getting used to (like any new profile would), but the surface area of the keys is much larger than most other profiles. Therefore, when typing, it feels as if your fingers have to travel significantly further to reach the next key. It also makes it much, much easier to fat finger extra keys. If I had realized how much more surface area there was, I would not have purchased these. However, they do look great, they were cheap, and they sound pretty good too.",

The backlit effect is, again, very pleasing.  The keycap set that I originally ordered was missing the F9 key.  I contacted their customer service through Amazon, and got a reply back right away and arranged for a replacement set to be shipped out.  Got it the new set the day after, and it was complete.

There's a really ugly and difficult to read quasi-sci-fi typeface used on the key caps. The keyboard itself is quite nice, quite heavy. Little kickstand-type feet if you want it angled. A small plastic ramp is included if  you want to rest  your left hand. What's missing here is a MANUAL of some kind. Even a PDF would be just great. Otherwise it's a mystery how this keyboard is supposed to work, what the features are. Somebody blew it. It's nicely designed with some interesting features, but unless you enjoy hardware sleuthing, how are you supposed to know what works, and how it works? Rather maddening.

        "text": "Oh wow!  I have waited for several days to review this because my computer was broken and I had to wait for a service tech to drive down and DO something, ANYTHING, with it. When the box came, I was asking myself what it was because the box was HUGE, The inner box was still pretty big, but not huge, It provides a lot of information--including that the keyboard is waterproof, nice since I'm a klutz--and something I'd either not noticed or had forgotten. In side that was a plain black box with a Bloody  hand--or is it a hand print?  The lights are cool, and the bloody hand lights up on both the keyboard and the Bloody Mouse I got a couple of days before the keyboard arrived.  The fast key response is amazing. Even though I'm not a &quot;gamer,&quot; I'm not a total computer novice, having gotten my first one with a gig on the hard drive--custom built--and my co-workers said I'd never use all that memory. Right. Now, my phone has 64 times that with room for expansion and does more than that first computer--or the second--and maybe more than the fifth or sixth.  I still have to download the software, which will probably wait until tomorrow, but I could not wait to start playing with this. It will take me a little bit to get used to the clicking keys, but I am finding I don't mind it, after just writing this much and, well, it does bring back memories. Also, they help me notice if I don't hit a key quite hard enough. (My high school graduation present was a used Royal portable typewriter in a horrible shade of blue--and I still dislike blue. But, I think I can get past those memories. My parents weren't cheap. They were broke at that point in time.) And now, I have probably spent more on this keyboard, even though I was amazingly fortunate to be able to get this at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, than my family spent on that typewriter.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect of this, but read what one of the other reviewers said about not needing to be a gamer to appreciate this and I can see, already, how true it is. My typing is faster and I'm just using this for the first time. And now with this and the matching mouse, I can dare to try some of the things I hear about. No, even with this pair, I won't have the fast response time of someone a few decades (well, quite a few) younger, but it will sure help even the playing field for me.  I am so eager to put this through its paces and I am SO happy with it, even this soon, that I have no problem recommending anything with the Bloody name on it.  And I did live in New Zealand for a while, so know that Bloody is not quite considered a polite word.  Too Bloody bad. I love the keyboard and mouse!<br /><br />Addendum: Two days along and I'm even happier! Wow! This thing is great!",

Fit and feel, construction, lighting scheme, and most importantly \u201cmechanical keys\u201d are all first rate.<br /><br />Right out of the box, you can feel the weight of this keyboard.  No lightweight here.  Plugging it in, there are no issues with Windows 7 to 10 \u2013 drivers are automatically detected and the keyboard is immediately available. The keys light up with a rainbow of color, with each row presenting a different color. On this B720 model, there is no way to change the color scheme, but most people will find it pleasant.  In idle mode, it presents a couple of animations, upon which any key touch will immediately bring back full lighting. Lighting is dimmable to totally \u201coff\u201d.<br /><br />Of course, you do not purchase a keyboard like this without awareness that a variety of mechanical key types exist.  My other keyboard is a Tt esport MEKA Cherry Brown with Cherry MX Brown switches.  Cherry MX brown switches have a moderate travel distance, with some tactile feedback for keystroke and a definite bottom and light clicking noise.  For me, Brown switches provide a nice blend for gaming and touch typing. The Bloody B720 has an Infrared Optic Switch exclusively developed by Bloody, and indicated to be closest to a Cherry MX Black switch. For me, comparing the Optic Switch to Cherry Brown switches, the throw distance seems shorter for the Bloody keys, with less resistance and the bottom just slightly softer.  Click wise, it is mechanically positive, but noise wise less than the brown switch.  Personally, I find both very desirable for the way I type and game, and struggle with finding a preference between \u201cOptic black\u201d and Cherry Brown.<br /><br />On other aspects of the keyboard, the Bloody B720 comes with textured and differently colored gaming silicone keys, along with a nice little left hand support for same.  The quick guide provides limited documentation and the Bloody website for software download. While I did not spend a lot of time with the software, it allows macros and some customization\u2014although no changes to lighting for the B720.<br /><br />If there is anything someone might not like about the Bloody B720 it would probably be the font selection for the keys (a bit sci-fi) along with an inability to control the lighting a bit more fully.  For me, it is fine, I like the way it behaves during use and in its more animated modes.<br /><br />Bloody Gaming may or may not be right about their own proprietary keys becoming popular, since gamers have definite preferences and a multitude of experiences with a variety of keyboards.  I can say, that for the type of work and play I do on a daily basis, I would recommend this keyboard to anyone thinking about a mechanical keyboard.  The Bloody B720 is an attractive solid keyboard providing a great mechanical key typing and gaming experience.",

        "text": "I really wanted this keyboard for the typewriter look, device swap, and 10-key.<br /><br />The only setback is that even when plugged in via USB to the main device when waking up there is a few seconds of buffering time before being able to type at times. At first, it drove me crazy but now I notice that the green light signals when this is happening and goes solid when ready which alleviates the \"let's go\" anxiety because I know what's happening. I love that it pairs to 3 devices. 2 via Bluetooth and one via usb.<br /><br />Another weird thing is maybe at least 1 time a week I have to unplug and plug the keyboard back in when I cannot type on my device and I know that the correct device is selected and the solid green light is on. If there were a better typewriter-style keyboard in all black and chrome with 10-key and pairs to at least 3 devices that don't have the buffering when swapping device or intermittent typing issue,  I would have picked it but it doesn't exist.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Key caps are already falling apart after 3 months use!

They look so nice and very very close and clean to the originals.<br /><br />the only way you can tell that they are not GMK is by looking at the bottom. The dye-sub is a little weak in the finish but you never look under the hood.<br /><br />If you like the greenery landscape or the color great fanatic this is the best set. It's super clean, subtle, and sounds great! I have this set on my KBD67 Lite and it sounds so much better than my ABS keycaps i paid $80 for. The texture is also very nice and I seem to be keen on this rough like texture than the ABS smoother feel. It kind of is matte if that makes sense.  The legends on all the alphas are uniform, no thickness issues.  The ,.? and other modifiers might have a thinner font but negligible.<br /><br />I can't say enough what a great first impression these sets have given me and if they produce an \"Oblivian\" replica i'm jumping on it as well.

        "text": "I opted for the \"brown\" keys and I must say that they feel and respond perfectly.  Just the right amount of \"clack\" and just the right amount of resistance.  The keys are normal width but the footprint is compact so you don't have to sacrifice any typing comfort for the portability or the ability to work in small spaces.  The keyboard itself is very weighty and between its heft and rubber feet it's pleasingly very stable - won't slide around on the desk.  The ability to use either USB or Bluetooth makes this thing incredibly versatile.  Thankfully it's USB-C so you don't have to worry about plug alignment, and the included USB cable is very good quality (braided nylon, strain relief) and length. The backlighting is decent, though not terribly even so some of the lettering doesn't look right in the dark.<br /><br />One big downside is the lack of dedicated Function keys (F1-F12).  This keyboard takes a cue from laptop keyboard design and introduces an \"Fn\" key which you have to hold in to change the function of normal keys to specialty operations, but instead of controlling volume or screen brightness, the \"Fn\" key is required to activate bluetooth pairing, an feature that acts sort of like Caps Lock but for function keys and of course the \"F\" keys.  The problem I ran into with this configuration is that the F1-F12 keys weren't being recognized with some devices.  I actually bought this specifically to use with a MiSTer FPGA device which supports standard USB keyboards and requires the F keys for certain basic functions.<br /><br />According to the instructions, the combination \"Fn + 1\" should look like an \"F1\" key press but it did not.  After poking at it for some time I discovered an undocumented (as in it's not in the instructions anywhere) feature which subtly changes the keyboard's operation.  The \"A\" and \"S\" keys have an additional label \"Os1\" and \"Os2\" respectively.  Holding \"Fn + A\" or \"Fn + S\" makes the keyboard backlight flash (which it does whenever you've changed some function of the keyboard itself).  With the keyboard set to \"Os2\" (Fn + S) the \"Fn + 1\" combination DOES send \"F1\" but, this arrangement also confusingly swaps the \"Window\" key and the left \"Alt\" key.<br /><br />Bottom Line ---<br />Pros:<br />- Heavy<br />- Quality keys, great feel<br />- Bluetooth & USB<br />- USB is USB-C and comes with a good cord<br />- Easy to plug in and use<br /><br />Neutral Observations:<br />- Backlight is uneven<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Instructions are incomplete<br />- Not having dedicated F1-F12 keys is problematic for gaming",

I mostly got them for arrow and WASD.  The main thing I'm noticing is that the top edges of the keycap, while aren't sharp in the sense that you may cut yourself, could really use just a TOUCH of softening.<br /><br />Also, the letters and arrows are actual cutouts.  it's possible for skin and debris to pass through them, so handle with care?  I haven't had them long enough to know if it makes more of a mess than standard pudding keycaps.  Also don't know if the heavier metal keycaps have any effect on longevity.  Definitely need less force to depress the keys.<br /><br />To get 5 stars, I think just softening the edges of the tops of the keycaps and maybe finding a way to have epoxy resin fill to seal the holes without affecting weigh or backlight visibility would be the only things I ask for.  Keep the dead skin cells and snack food dust from slipping through the top of the keycap.",

My primary motivator for buying this keyboard was to try out the GamaKay Phoenix switches, but I also like the look and size of the keyboard. The price is also really good, in my opinion. Right now this keyboard is the one I reach for the most. I really like the quiet thump of the switches and they feel nice to use, but to be clear - they aren't actually silent. I've had a few annoyances with this keyboard occasionally not \"waking up\". The lights will respond, but typing doesn't show up. It's an easy fix. I just switch the input type over to BT and then back to USB since I've been using it wired. It immediately starts responding again. This isn't a consistent issue, but is a small thing that I wish didn't happen.",

Hotswappable switches and caps give you a good platform for changes later.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Stock caps are very plasticky and not the best I've used. Print quality and shape are good, but the material makes them feel hollow and gives an odd echo to each keypress. Will be replacing.<br />- No risers. The flat angle of the keyboard is not comfortable. Needs some sort of elevation in the back.<br /><br />Meh:<br /><br />-Stock switches are not the best I've used, not the worst. The yellow gateron's are among my favorite switches. They have a great overall feel. Some keys, particularly spacebar, have some \"springy\" sound to them and need lubrication or cushioning. Fortunately, the switches are swappable, and this can be adjusted if you're down for further investment and/or a project.<br />- Bluetooth connects well, but is sometimes laggy on input. Not a huge deal for regular typing, but I wouldn't game on it.<br />- LED's are always \"moving.\" There's no way to set it to one color and leave it, which is my preferred color set.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />This keyboard is a decent platform for customization and you can MAKE this keyboard into exactly what you want, but I think it's overpriced if that's what you're getting it for.",

        "text": "I own quite a few of these multi-mode mechanical keyboards, and this is my favorite one by far. The build quality is phenomenal. PBT plastic keycaps with an XDA profile, dual flip out feet, the small layout WITH dedicated arrow keys, and even RGB backlighting. The keyboard uses a USB-C connection for wired mode. You also get a 2.4ghz dongle for wireless connectivity if you don't have Bluetooth. If you do, then you can connect and swap between 3 different Bluetooth devices. The ON/OFF switch and the connection mode switch are on the left side of the keyboard as opposed to the bottom. The RGB backlighting shines around the keycaps but not through them as PBT does not play well with allowing backlighting through a key as it is firmer and heavier than ABS. Still, with the white case cover the lighting looks great. You can also turn off backlighting to extend the battery life of the built-in battery. If you download the driver software, you can easily change the backlighting options without having to worry about remembering too many key combinations. This keyboard looks good and feels better. I got the option with the silver speed switches, and it is a dream with this keyboard. The speed of the actuation plus the feel of the solid PBT makes this keyboard the most comfortable that I own. This keyboard is now my daily driver, even above my HHKB. I highly recommend you try this keyboard. If you want a reduced layout with solid construction and fast response, you cannot get better than this anywhere.",

The doubleshot legends are quite clear and none of the spacebars are warped! This is a new profile I've never typed on and I can't find much information on the web about it so I included a lot of pictures. I compared them in the pictures to my Ducky keyboard with doubleshot ABS. They actually aren't too different from OEM keycap profile (from the Ducky) height but some of the rows are higher. They're much more shapely and the F and J keys have a deeper dish. Compared to DSA keycaps, they don't seem to be quite as deep dishey overall which I actually prefer.<br />The keycaps fit snug on cherry mx brown stems, more so than my Ducky keycaps. They aren't hard to put on though. Some of the stems have a small part of plastic missing from the MX cross area but it's only a handful of the keycaps and it didn't effect the fit. I've included photos of this as well.<br />Overall they're great keycaps that I won't be using yet until my keyboard for them arrives.",

The noise from my keyboard comes from the sound the springs make when the button pops back up, and these o-rings work to muffle sound when the keys are pressed down. For keyboards with raised keys that don't bottom out, like mine, and for switches that make more noise when they come back up instead of when they go down, the o-rings are not effective for reducing noise.<br /><br />Otherwise, the product is good, and I'm keeping the o-rings for when I eventually change out the switches on my keyboard entirely.",

In fact, it's so comfortable the only caps that I think are nicer are Drop's MT3 which cost double and don't come with as much layout variation without buying extra kits.<br /><br />This specific set, Dracula's Castle, also comes with custom novelites and two different colors worth of compatibility (crimson and black) for a lot of the keys to make your board look exactly the way you want.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend anything in ASA profile.

The keycaps themselves are fairly nice and the font of the legends are a lot more consistent than their cherry profile sets. The packing is nice albeit a little frustrating as you pretty much need to use a keycap puller to remove the keycaps. The ASA profile is what I found the most interesting, if I had to compare it to anything I would actually compare it to OEM profile but slightly taller with rounded edges than something SA profile, The sculpting is a lot more derivative of OEM than SA in my opinion. The typing feel is pretty great it is very reminiscent of OEM profile so if you are used to OEM profile you will be right at home. The sound is more clacky than thocky at least in my NK65 with Gateron Cap Gold Switches. Overall the keycaps are nice and the ASA profile is a pleasant surprise coming from someone that uses both SA and OEM profile fairly regularly.",

What they do is tough on the keyboards and often switches break or become less responsive which may lead to a gamer losing a match. These snap right in to the sockets and can instantly rebuild the whole keyboard like new. I realize they would not be used by your everyday person or casual gamer but when it gets serious they are  the switches to be used.",

I tried both keycaps on multiple boards and I am thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />I can easily say that this keycap set will fit both regular MX stems and box stems, as they fit on my box inks and NK creams without issue. I swapped them on 6 different boards just to see how they looked with different sets and did not find there to be any loosening.<br /><br />Being able to change the \"screen\" is a fun touch but I am leaving it on the apple logo for nostalgia. The keyboard on the tab key is magnetic and I have found myself playing with it while working today.<br /><br />Overall this is an easy 10/10 for both price and quality.

        "text": "Pros:<br />- Beautifully and conveniently packaged and organized. Caps come on three trays with plastic film on them so that nothing will have shifted in transit. It's very easy to replace your caps and keep your old set save and organized in the trays, too. Simple to find any specialized keys that you may need in the trays.<br />- Print is easy to see and seems durable/high contrast. No funky fonts that are hard to read.<br />- Looks awesome with RGB.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- There are no tactile nubs on the F and J keys to indicate homerow. As a touch typist, this was almost a dealbreaker.<br />- Color is way off from the images in the description. The images in the description show a clear white color to the keycaps. Along with the \"clear/translucent\" descriptors, I believed I was going to get more of a white/iced translucent look. Nope. The caps are basically colorless clear. They are smooth and glossy with no texture. I left some of the OG white keys on my keyboard to show the color clearly side by side. Not the look I was expecting from the images and description.<br /><br />Good to know:<br /><br />- I've never used ASA profile before, and generally prefer XDA, so these are a little taller than I'm used to on XDA, but more rounded (and, I think, more comfortable, than OEM. I had some lousy stock OEM caps on my old keyboard, and I do feel these caps are an improvement. They are sufficiently dense, and give me a slightly deeper, more muted sound from my keypresses with my brown switches, which I like, compared to the more plasticky/hollow caps that were original to my board.<br />- Despite having a glossy finish, I don't find these keys to be slippery--the slight curvature leads your fingertips toward the center of the keys easily and they're comfortable to use.<br />- I really hate that there are no homerow nubs. Who skips that? Come on.",

        "text": "I have the \u201cWhite\u201d color option in this set of keycaps from Akko. White is a bit misleading, the color is actually glossy and nearly translucent. This is actually what I wanted, I was looking all over for nearly clear keycaps, but I did want to point that out.<br /><br />If you like maximum backlighting, this might be the set for you. I was using white pudding caps before, and I thought they let a lot of light shine through. The difference is night and day. These Akko caps show backlighting on all sides and the top of the cap. I\u2019ve included a picture of a white pudding cap surrounded by the clear Akkos to show the difference.<br /><br />I\u2019m using the keycaps with Akko Vintage White (MX) switches. The keycaps fit well, but they took a bit of force to fit on the switches.<br /><br />I am disappointed the F and J keys do not have ridges or bumps. I\u2019m a touch typist and using an ergo board with 56 keys, I rely on those ridges to help me orient my hands. This set has so much variety that I wish Akko had included doubles of F and J or even blanks with the ridges.<br /><br />Speaking of keycap variety: the set has some great 1u options! My current keyboard is an Iris Rev 6, all keys are 1u size. But most keycap sets don\u2019t have 1u keycaps for Shift, Control, Command/Windows, and so on. This set does, which is a big help. I also like the cute animal keycaps, they add some fun to my board.<br /><br />I believe the ASA height is original to Akko. They have a helpful height chart on their site, comparing ASA to OEM, JDA, OSA, and Cherry. I was using OEM before, and switching to ASA and the glossy feel of the keycaps took about two days of adjustment.",

Found this epomaker one and I've bought products from epomaker before and haven't had any issues, and since this cable was only $20 I figured I could risk it. I was even happier when I saw they had a lavender option, most places just have light pink but not lavender. This cable matches my keycaps perfectly. The coiled part lays flat right out of the box (I've seen a few from other companies where the coiled part kinda curls up, which I didnt want), the cable feels nice and sturdy and good quality, and the metal connector also feels nice and heavy. I also like that this is a woven cable and not just plastic/rubber wrapped. Had no issues with the keyboard working after plugging in the cable. Absolutely worth the $20, I might buy the light pink one to match my other keyboards.",

During a recent move I left my previously mentioned perfectly fine working keyboard outside for an extended period of time, uncovered in the rain and sun and any other elements that rolled though Southern California for those few months. When I finally returned to the keyboard, I found that it had become yet another casualty of the pandemic. Finally I had good cause for a new keyboard, and my research led me to try this one. And like the famous tattoo says, I have no ragrets!<br /><br />I plugged it in and immediately it lit up and off my little fingies went, zipping around the keyboard with the grace and elegance of a gold medal winning gymnast at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Every click and clack was like music to my ears, each sentence I typed sounding like a symphony composed by Mozart himself! I now look forward to typing my weekly emails to mother, catching her up with her favorite son\u2019s (sorry Richard, but you know it\u2019s true!) comings and goings!<br />I\u2019ve only had this keyboard for about a week, so time will tell if it will hold up to the rigorous poundings that accompany each email I compose, but as of now I would not hesitate to recommend this keyboard to all my many (ok, zero) friends!

The only problem I found was that the USB-C male input was a tad long for my ANNE PRO Clone, a Dierya x Kemove DK61 60% Keyboard. It might be my keyboard's own build quality, or that maybe these cables are meant for more rugged custom boards. If I move my keyboard drastically it might disconnect, but luckily that rarely happens. I'm more than satisfied with the cable, more like enamored.

        "text": "Hi, I am a bit of a keyboard junky.  I have bought probably 10 mechanical keyboards over the last 3 years.  I still have an original IBM PC keyboard - that is really stiff and loud.  But about this keyboard, I read an online review and said, why not - and I have been using it for several days.  First, it sets up easy.  Just plug in to get started.  Configuring all the lights is more work and not completely intuitive - especially if you lose the little manual 3x4\" or so.  Personally, I don't care that much for the lighting features on any keyboard - I want to know if I can type quickly without any errors from the keyboard as opposed from me.  In general, this keyboard is one of the best.  The key depression effort is light to medium - if you rest your fingers on the keys, they will not trigger -which is good.  The space bar works well - and I usually find this a problem because I hit it a bit off center - but this one works well.  The noise is medium.  The clacky sound is the sound of me pressing the keys to the maximum and not the click of the membrane.<br /><br />I generally like this keyboard and I have tried many from $79 mechanical keys to $200 keyboards.  I think this is up there with the best - maybe not all the bells and whistles like volume control, but I never use that.  Buy this.  Works well.  Feels good under the fingers.  Type fast!",

        "text": "I have the version with white keycaps and \"box white\" clicky switches. I don't play computer games, so I can't comment on that aspect of the keyboard. But I can say that this is a very good typist's keyboard. The key switches sound like Cherry Blues, but I think these feel smoother, and have less lateral wiggle room.<br /><br />The keyboard comes with a tiny \"user guide\" that is no more than a list of keystrokes that control the lighting and macros. I don't care for lighting on a keyboard, so the first thing I tried to do was dim the lights.  The \"user guide\" wasn't very clear on that, so here's how:<br /><br />While holding down the \"Fn\" key...<br />... press the Down arrow to dim the white lights.<br />... press the \"2\" key on the numeric keypad to dim the colored perimeter lights.<br /><br />Keep pressing those keys to dim the lights further. I've now got them completely dimmed, and I hope they stay that way.<br /><br />One thing to know about this keyboard is that the keycaps aren't recessed. On most keyboards, you can't see or grasp the bottoms of the keycaps, because they fit into cavities formed by the molded plastic deck. This keyboard's top deck is flat metal, without cavities. So there's about a quarter-inch gap between the keycap bottoms and the top of the deck. As a result, it's easy to pull the keycaps. You can even remove the Escape key with your bare fingers. I don't think this is a bad thing; it's just worth knowing about.<br /><br />Speaking of keycaps, these use a stylized font that sacrifices legibility for fashion. The designer apparently dislikes closed shapes, and created little vertical gaps in the Q, O, zero, 8, etc. Not even the ampersand, pound sign, or the little orbs of the percent sign are spared this annoying treatment. It looks like the dye is flaking away.  As a sometimes hunt-and-peck typist, I find this very distracting, as it keeps me from instantly recognizing many of the keys.<br /><br />I would rate this keyboard with five stars, if not for the inadequate \"user guide\" and the poorly thought-out keycap font.",

        "text": "TLDR: If you don't want to deal with pre-ordering the Wooting60HE or just really like Steelseries products, this is a really good 60% option.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Omnipoint switches feel very good<br />-Adjustable actuation point<br />-Finally adopted PBT keycaps for longevity<br />-Good RGB brightness and accuracy<br />-Pretty good stabs out of the box made better with some lube<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The Wooting60HE exists...<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />Rant time. Right out of the gate, this would be the perfect 60% keyboard currently, if the Wooting60HE didn't exist. It has hotswap switches, acoustic foam, analog functionality, adjustable actuation point, RAPID TRIGGER (huge for high actuation point users), pre-lubed switches and stabs, and doesn't require its software to be active to function fully. This board isn't bad by any means, it's just that the wooting is just better in my opinion. I saw steelseries' video today comparing their \"response time\" with some weird rigged comparison test where they claim a 10ms advantage over the wooting. Even if that were true, which I don't think is accurate, 10ms isn't enough to justify choosing this over the wooting, unless you just really like Steelseries products, which is fine. But the rapid trigger functionality alone is HUGE for switches with a high actuation. If you don't know what that is, basically at any point during the upward travel (after you've pressed a key), you can press down again, to register another keypress. It basically makes the actuation dynamic letting you keep that high actuation, but not require you to fully release the key to press it again. Anyway, rant/PSA over, back to the Apex.<br /><br />Despite everything I just said, this is still a really good keyboard. If you liked the Apex Pro/TKL, you'll like this. I've found that magnetic switches are easily the smoothest ones on the market, even without lubing. They just glide, absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />I would comment on the responsiveness, but honestly, I really can't imagine milliseconds making a huge difference for movement inputs in a shooter. Osu probably if that's your thing, but starting to move in one direction or another a milisecond faster isn't going to change your game in the slightest. A mouse, absolutely, but there's really no keyboard input that needs that level of precision. So try not to get hung up on responsiveness in regards to keyboard claims.<br /><br />Something definitely worth noting is how magnetic switches and optical switches are basically immune to double presses that eventually happen to regular mechanical switches. You can rest assure that all of your key presses will be very accurate.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Before you commit to this, I highly recommend looking into the Wooting60HE. If you don't want to deal with pre-ordering, or just really like Steelseries products, this is still a really good keyboard. I love the switches, and am so happy they decided to finally start using PBT keycaps.",

        "text": "These keycaps are thick, double shot so they will never fade, and sculpted. With ortholinear keyboards, these keycaps really help adjusting to smaller modifer key size and different key layout.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Thick: This helps lower the pitch of the sound, which makes it sound quieter.<br />2. Doubleshot ABS: No wearing out the legends. The font is also fairly thick, making it much more legible than some other keycaps.<br />3. MT3 profile: The sculpted profile really makes it very comfortable to use and helps reduce hitting the wrong keys. No sharp edges due to the spherical shape. Very enjoyable for typing. The profile is much higher though so that could be an issue for some people.<br />4. Multiple profile options for certain keys: For example, the Ctrl and Esc keycs come in profiles that would allow it to be the top row or 3rd row. Space bar comes as two 1u, two 1.5u, and one 2u.<br />5. Storage tray and box: This seems silly to put as a pro but the tray and box it comes with make it easy to store unused or keycaps it replaced. Other Keycaps come in a zip lock bag that will just be a jumbled mess.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Price. This is really expensive for a set of keycaps but this is the normal price for any specialty keycaps. It is what it is.<br />2. Limitation of scultped profile: Putting key profiles meant for row 1 in row 3 feels awkward so you might end you designing your keymap partially based on keycap profiles. Also might end up rotating some keycaps like row 5 Raise or Lower layer keycaps to make it more comfortable.<br />3. ABS option only. The PBT version is in white only. So if you prefer the color with the material that it isn't made it, then you're out of luck.<br />4. Limited to buying sets if you need extra keys: If you need more keys, you have to order a set. I would like to have more 1.5u blank keycaps but don't want to buy multiple sets just for the few pieces I want.",

Initially I thought the MT3 profile was disorienting, but after using them for a while, I am quite fond of it. I acknowledge that not everyone will like this profile though, and that should be considered if you are buying this product (or any like it). If you can find an MT3 set to try first before dumping about two hundred dollars on keycaps, it would be a **very good** idea. Other things go without saying, the thickness is very good the weight on my switches feels good and not like its making keys too easy to press or anything. I really like the theme, but all of that considered, I bought this specifically for the VI keys (hjkl with arrows) because I thought they looked super cool.<br /><br />The price for these keycaps is a good deterrent for most people, for good reason. However this high of a price is pretty standard for high quality keycaps, as well as the Drop.com-exclusive MT3 profile.<br /><br />This leads me to the value for money, its expensive and definitely should only be bought if you have a hankering to spend money on some expensive keycaps or you really really like having a specific row of keycaps.<br />Brightness is a 1 star because they're not shine-through keycaps, as they should be.<br />Gaming is a 4 star because, like, Sure? nothing about these keycaps keep you from gaming.",

So, I have to use the lift pieces without the wrist pads which leaves a chunk of awkward plastic sticking straight out from the keyboard; something I am constantly catching.  It's frustrating to no end.<br /><br />I am now looking for something I can simply glue to the inner, underside of the keyboard that will add the lift but leave the front open.<br /><br />I'm also disappointed with the price.  Come on now.  It's sooooo overpriced.  It's only a matter of time before another brand comes out with a more reasonable one- but in the meantime, I feel like they are taking advantage.<br /><br />In the end, this is far better than nothing.  It definitely places your hands in a more ergonomic position, and is better than a flat keyboard or laptop touchpad setup.",

And, without them, this keyboard isn't as great.<br /><br />I purchased the tenting separately, and it really helps with ergonomics when typing. But, when gaming it tends to push my hands side and down, so it's better to use a separate palm support.<br /><br />I was surprised that when the keyboard is laid out, it is as wide as a ten keyless keyboard. I was hoping that it would be shorter, so that the mouse has more room. It's fine for work or just typing. For gaming, I'll put the right section farther up. Or, I'll put it above the keyboard tray, so I still have access to the keys when needed. That frees up a lot of room for the mouse.<br /><br />The quality of the keyboard is great. Everything feels solid. The keys feel wonderful. And, the ergonomics is great for typing.<br />The tech support was friendly and helpful. I had a bit of a problem early on with customizing the keys, and their tech support promptly helped me.",

        "text": "I have tried all the Kinesis keyboards with the exception of the 400$ console setup. I have chosen this one as the best overall experience, specifically paired with the VIP3Pro tent and wrist accessory. The keys on this keyboard have a much more consistent and pleasant feeling as compared to their membrane offerings as well as their silent switch option. Those keyboards are fantastic if you are not already addicted to the feeling of mechanical keys. However if you are searching for the ultimate in keyboard experiences for daily use, I heavily and without reservation recommend this keyboard set. The keyboard may initially seem expensive when compared to other ergonomic keyboards that do not split or offer the tenting/wrist rests, however having tried many different curved and non split ergonomic options from Microsoft, Logitech, and many others, I can say without a doubt that the optimal configuration requires the keyboard to be split. If you need to have a number pad like I do, I suggest any simple number key option, they'll fit nicely between the two halves and do not interfere at all. I plan to purchase a second keyboard for my WFH setup to compliment my work setup. I don't want to go back to a standard keyboard and you won't either after using it.<br /><br />This review was not endorsed, sponsored, or influenced by any 3rd party, I am simply that overjoyed with the product.",

It is a pleasure to type on and the space bars and other stabilized keys feel great. Out of the box I don't think there is anything you need to do to this keyboard except use it!<br /><br />Some things will take getting use to like the smaller shift button. I actually wouldn't mind if this board was spread out a bit more to allow for more traditional length buttons, but I'm sure it is something I could pick up quickly.<br /><br />The build quality feels excellent and the polished steel plate on the bottom is a great touch. It really looks classy and I love the look of this keyboard. Nuphy's color-ways have always been super slick to me and this is no different.<br /><br />The board has awesome RGB effects that you can change easily from the board itself. It connects wired, through bluetooth, or through a 2.4ghz adapter. Bluetooth connected instantly and works super well.<br /><br />It comes with a ton of accessories, from magnetic feet to tilt the board a bit to extra keycaps, pullers, switches, stickers, and the instructions are also a poster of an anime chick which would probably look good in a gamer style room.<br /><br />I am really tempted to try and use this board as a daily driver but right now I'm using it with it sitting on my M1 Macbook Airs keyboard and it is working great for that use case. It is thin enough that it doesn't block the screen or anything like that.<br /><br />I have another compact 60% board that has the same goals as this Nuphy board and it misses the mark. Nuphy really hit the nail on the head with this board.",

I'm impressed by how long a single AA battery lasts in this mouse. I haven't had to replace the battery since getting it 6 months ago even with daily use.

I have long fingers, but not necessarily large hands, and this fits perfectly for me. The scroll wheel is nice and smooth (and also quiet). You can feel some tactile \"knurling\" when you scroll, so it's not baby's-butt-smooth, but it's not like scrolling over a circular-saw blade either.<br /><br />Using the USB dongle, the mouse is very responsive. The Bluetooth connection seemed a little laggy to me. No stars off unless it does the same when I test it on another PC.<br /><br />I do not intend to install the Logitech Options software so I cannot speak to the usefulness of Flow or reassigning buttons.<br /><br />Pros<br />- USB and Bluetooth connectivity<br />- Can use with up to two devices.<br />- 7 buttons: L, R, Center, Center-Left, Center-Right, Back, Forward. Eight if you include the PC selector button.<br />- Very quiet left/right click buttons<br />- Nearly quiet center click and back/forward buttons<br />- Uses one AA battery (preferred over non-replaceable battery)<br />- Battery life advertised at 2 years.<br />- Has an on/off switch on the bottom<br /><br />Cons<br />- Possible laggy response using Bluetooth. I need to test on another PC to be sure.<br /><br />Other consideration:<br />- The USB dongle storage is behind the battery door. If you frequently remove the dongle from the PC, this might be a concern for you (it's not a problem for me).",

They best the Bose Companion II which sound terrible in comparison.  the Bose sound shallow and weak.  These speakers have 3 1/2 inch long throw woofers for the midrange, and a real subwoofer for the lows.  They are great sounding for what they are and the best computer speakers to my knowledge in the $200 or below genre.<br /><br />However, they need to be tweaked.  The subwoofer is slightly heavy (although an adjustment is on your speakers) and the highs are slightly bright like other Klipsch speakers, and the midrange is slightly recessed.  Simply set your computer system from Windows at 70% output roughly, then pull up iTunes (if you use it) or another equalizer, and set the low bass from about 65K down about 3db below average, put the midrange from about 125K on up to about three 3DB higher than normal, then set the 1K at zero, and above that from 2K on up about 3db below zero.  You can adjust that a little to make a curve<br /><br />These speakers are great.  I went with refurbished myself at a little over half price.  Enjoy!  They are great.<br /><br />P.S.  I am an audiophile who has a good ear and an extremely good stereo system.  These do not equal that, but sound great for what they are and better than all others for $200 or less and close to the $400 plus systems.",

        "text": "There is simply no better set of computer speakers out there.  The subwoofer rivals those home theater setups as well.  I have this in my office connected to a Mac Mini which I often use for iTunes and watching movies, and recording to Garageband.<br /><br />I have never cranked the volume 100%, it's incredibly loud at 65%.  Bass is very smooth and powerful.<br /><br />I actually needed speakers for an outdoor wedding and actually brought these to the event, no one complained about not being able to hear the ceremony even 20 rows back.<br /><br />If you can't afford a home theatre system, consider this 2.1 for your living room as well.  This will surprise you.",

        "text": "I bought this in a time crunch.  My wired mouse was getting hard to use because the scroll wheel had shifted out of place.  I had several wireless mice around, but none of them still had their wireless receiver.  And they were before the days of Bluetooth.  So, I had was in the market for a new one.<br /><br />This one is nice.  It fits the hand well and all.  But, I realized that it did not have the features that I was used to.  First, it is not a quiet mouse.  I did not notice at first, but when it penetrated my fog of concentration, I could not unhear it.  Click.  Click.  Click!  And, this was not great for conference calls either.<br /><br />The other issue was that it tracked slower than I would like.  I was still using my wired mouse at this point, so I did not want to change mouse settings via software.  I really missed having a dpi button on my mouse.  This is important to me as I use a laptop on an extended display to a 2nd monitor.  So, I need to be able to zip from one end of the screen the other - quick enough to unmute and answer a question during a conference call.<br /><br />Have to click to wake up the mouse kept catching my attention - which means it was on it's way to annoying me... I have worked with computers for so long, it's like an extension of me.  It needs to be intuitive to use and not interrupt my flow.<br /><br />And, at this point, I figured out that I would need to use two different computers at once.  And, while I could pair this wireless mouse with a wired one, the USB ports required were a challenge.  My newer computer has no USB C ports at all.  So, this limited my set-up options.  Secondly, I now had 2 mice crowding limited desk space.<br /><br />So, I learned that there was such a thing as multi-device mice.  And, I found one that can switch between two computers and a iPad - with a simple LED indicator so that you know which device you are controlling.  I bought the also designed to be silent and to switch between different dpi.  All these features and it was only $3 more.<br /><br />This is what I bought to replace this one - Arteck Multi-Device Wireless Bluetooth Mouse with Nano USB Receiver Ergonomic Right Hand Silent Clicking for Computer Desktop PC Laptop Mac iPad and Windows 10/8 iPad OS Build in Rechargeable Battery<br /><br />So, to sum it up, I would say that I need the speed and responsiveness of a gamer's mouse with the silent clicks and 3 device connects like an office worker.  So, this mouse is ok.  But, if you are an advance or intense user, you may find that it does meet your needs.",

(No issue with the texture of the buttons, so imo, its best to just not use them and keep the mouse as light as possible)<br /><br />Its definitely an improvement over the stock plastic feel, which is too smooth for me. These add some grip, and even a bit of cushion.<br /><br />Guess I was expecting a more grippy feeling. Maybe a more pronounced texture.  There is definitely room for improvement for those of us with sweaty gaming hands.<br /><br />I also wish the edges were tapered off at its edges rather than a hard cut, but that's a minor nitpick and not too important.<br /><br />I will say with these grips, I am having trouble deciding between which mouse to use primarily... G Pro Wireless or Viper Ultimate. This is definitely something that was missing from the G Pro Wireless's design for me.",

When i received this one I was skeptical because it did feel lite weight and I worried it would be cheap quality. It is comfortable & light weight, rechargeable long lasting charge. I use it for work it lasts all day and since I work from home I used it at night as well without needing a recharge until bed time. I have switched to regular mouse a couple times when i forgot to charge mine and there is a huge difference in comfort. I have a hand injury and when i use a regular mouse my hand hurts, after using this one I see a  big difference when I have had to switch back. Highly recommend.<br /><br />** update: i\u2019ve now had this for several months and I have actually ordered another one which I haven\u2019t had to take out of the box.

The SoftSkin surface of the Drakonia Black offers a soft grip and prevents perspiration build-up, ensuring the mouse fits perfectly in the hand even during heated battles. Likewise, the ergonomic shape of the Drakonia Black is designed for stability and control: its outwardly curved underside offers more grip during very small and precise movements as well as a high-level of comfort during long gaming sessions. Therefore the Drakonia Black is aimed especially at FPS Snipers and RTS/RPG gamers - the type of players who typically launch themselves into long battles and epic adventures. In the underside of the Drakonia Black you will find six metal weights comprising the Weight Tuning System, allowing the fighting weight of the mouse to be adjusted at any time.

It was seriously so easy to just pair and go, and I love how it can be paired with three different things (just push a little button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between computers/iPads). It feels okay in my hand - not the highest quality I\u2019ve seen (plastic is very basic and it is pretty lightweight as well), but it doesn\u2019t feel cheap. The color is so fun, which is the main reason I got it. Also it is very quiet and doesn\u2019t have any loud clicking. The one thing to mention is that the circle button under the scrolling wheel doesn\u2019t have any functionality with an iPad. Nothing was happening when I kept clicking it to try and use the emoji shortcut, so after heading over to Logitech\u2019s website i saw \u201c*Emojis and software are currently supported on Windows\u00ae and macOS only.\u201d So maybe iPadOS will eventually support this capability, but as of now it is useless.

        "text": "I like the mouse.  Excellent value for money, except for one very annoying flaw.  It is constantly disconnecting the bluetooth connection from my new Macbook Pro.  It's pretty annoying.<br /><br />After what feels like only a few minutes of idle time, the mouse bluetoothe disconnects.  Then when I move it nothing happens for a couple seconds.  The finally, it connects and my laptop tells me the mouse is back, and it works perfectly...  until the next time it is idle.<br /><br />I have use other low cost brands as well as my Apple Magic Mouse (which I don't use as I prefer a track wheel).  I have not had any issues with the Bluetooth on those, only this one...<br /><br />If it were not for the disconnect issue I would rate the mouse a 5 star.  Otherwise, I give it a 3.  I am still using it for now, but will find a better one...<br /><br />UPDATE:  Okay, I find that I am CONSTANTLY drustrated that this mouse loses connection with my laptop.  PITA.  Not worth using at any price.",

        "title": "Very good price-point for Laptop portability and Features",
        "text": "Rating this PINKCAT wireless mouse is difficult in terms of \"stars\". The price-point and your intended use are big factors.<br /><br />I'll get one thing out of the way to save you some time - if you're a gamer, I would say that this is not going to have the stable accuracy you need. In fact, I think it will frustrate gamers, so if you're a gamer then you need to move on/up to something more expensive. Just my opinion.<br /><br />My usage is for work. Lots and lots of work - like 12-15 hours a day of non-stop \"click click click\" work, so I'm basing my review on that and in comparison, to my main \"workhorse\" mouse.<br /><br />My main mouse is a Logitech Anywhere MX, which is an incredible mouse but is also about $50 more than this PINKCAT mouse. I wanted to find something similar in both size and features as my more expensive mouse but with silent click and more as a backup, and for basic uses this fits the bill pretty well.<br /><br />As you can see in the photos, this mouse is only slightly larger than a Logitech Anywhere MX, so it's still plenty small enough for laptop / portable / small space use. Now that you know what I'm comparing it to, I'll get right to the pros & cons.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Very light-weight, significantly lighter than my MX, yet still similar in size & shape.<br /><br />- The \"silent\" buttons are truly that! Something I wish was a feature with my noisy MX buttons.<br /><br />- Only requires one AA battery (my MX requires two) and excellent battery life.<br /><br />- Scroll-wheel is smooth, quiet, and comfortable.<br /><br />- The dull mat style surface is very comfy and doesn't get sticky like the shiny slick surface of my MX.<br /><br />- The \"back\" and \"forward\" thumb-buttons work as expected for quick switching back & forth on web pages and tabs / locations in file explorer folders.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Even with the \"3 Grade Adjustable DPI\" function, I wouldn't recommend this mouse for gaming or fine digital artwork in apps like Photoshop.<br /><br />- The signal and receiver seem to be a little easily susceptible to signal issues and occasional jitter, but that could be due to the number of various devices I have in the room. When I first tested it out there seemed to be a lot of jitter and the cursor jumped around a bit, but after switching it to a different system than the one I used my MX on, and adjusting the mouse settings a bit in Windows, it has been pretty smooth.<br /><br />- No side-to-side push with the scroll wheel, unlike my MX. (But again, we're talking $8 compared to $58).<br /><br />- Battery compartment door is flimsy. It's OK, but handle with care when popping it open.<br /><br />Overall, this mouse is fine for basic use, and for its price-point it's excellent.<br /><br />This was really hard to rate in terms of \"stars\" , especially coming from the perspective of someone who owns a more finely tuned & designed expensive mouse. So... for the price and for basic use I'd give it 5 stars, but for smooth accuracy it's not going to measure-up to something like a high-end Logitech and would be more like 3 stars in that aspect. But for 8 bucks It's a great mouse - gets the job done for standard computer uses, and it's definitely light, silent buttons! So over all I have to give it 4 stars.",

When I took the keyboard out 1 letter had popped off. No biggie, it snapped back on easily. The keyboard buttons are bit higher than I'm used to so I was typing slower and it was a bit uncomfortable after a while. I planned on switching back to my regular keyboard shortly but what escalated that switch was how loud the keyboard was while I was typing. My office is usually rather quiet plus I'm in a cubicle and a coworker asked what are you doing over there!?! He said it sounded like I was hammering the letters with a small hammer.

        "text": "My Logitech M310 (been using them for 10-15 years) could not connect properly with my USB-C/Thunderbolt MacBookPro, using their USB dongle, thru a USB adapter. Scroll wheel would NOT work, and Logitech tech support said they would not update drivers. 'Don't use an adapter.' But they aren't aware that new Macs don't have old-school USB ports? Anyone else have this problem?! Anyway... this Seenda connects directly with Bluetooth, and connects instantly. If it sleeps (after a few hours?) it wakes and re-connects with one click, in less than a second. I charged the battery when I bought it a few weeks ago, and forgot that I might need to charge it again one day. Still going. Downsides: it is much smaller and lighter than I am used to (the M310 is easily twice as thick/tall) so I am getting used to that. Took awhile to find the right DPI/resolution/speed (and the button to change that is in a precarious, easy-to-hit-by-mistake position. Overall a great recommend.",

        "text": "When purchasing a bluetooth mouse, or any bluetooth device, an important factor is how well it connects and how well it STAYS connected.  After all this time, the industry still can\u2019t make up its mind about how bluetooth works:<br />- Microsoft with their mouse and Sony with their controller that pair without the need of a code (which Android\u2019s bluetooth stack doesn\u2019t support).<br />- Mice and keyboards that will not reconnect after it wakes from sleep mode.<br />- To this day, bluetooth devices still can\u2019t wake a computer from suspend state.<br />So when I get a simple bluetooth mouse for a good price, and it actually works as expected, I was happy.<br /><br />For my review, I\u2019m comparing the Bornd mouse to the [[ASIN:B006428K7I Motorola 89519N Bluetooth Mouse]] which I got in a set that included the [[ASIN:B004L9MBH6 Motorola Wireless Keyboard for Motorola ATRIX and XOOM (Motorola Retail Packaging)]].<br /><br />With the Motorola mouse, its frequency somehow conflicts with the Motorola keyboard, resulting in sticky keys, as in \u201cI\u2019m having a good daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay\u201d.  Conversely, the keyboard interferes with the mouse where the computer would actually lose connection with the mouse for a few seconds after typing, or lose connection completely.<br /><br />What I liked about the Bornd:<br />- Pairing was simple using the button at the bottom of the mouse.<br />- Operating distance is about 5 feet, but this may be because of my computer\u2019s bluetooth antenna<br />- Takes a single AA battery which lasts over a month of moderate use (2 hours per day)<br />- Mouse movement is good.  No need to adjust mouse speed in the control panel.<br />- Accuracy is good.  Editing images using Pixlr.com, I\u2019m able to select precisely the parts of the image I need.<br /><br />What gave me trouble with the Bornd:<br />- When you first put your hand on this mouse, you will not feel that it is very well built.  The plastic is completely smooth and the mouse wheel seems to rattle when you shake it.  I got used to it after a few minutes, though.<br />- The mouse reconnects with the computer most of the time, but sometimes it was necessary to turn the mouse off and on again after the computer reboots or if the computer was out of range for an extended period of time.<br />- Lately, I\u2019ve been experiencing double-clicks when I click on the left mouse button once.  I\u2019m usually able to fix this by getting angry and slamming the mouse down a couple of times.  This may indicate a build quality issue with this mouse.<br /><br />In my specific case, the Bournd did not interfere with my Motorola keyboard at all and it seems the sticky key occurs only when the batteries on the keyboard runs low.",

        "text": "UPDATE: Two months! Two months this mouse lasted, and that was with very light use. Fully charged, I was just scrolling with it when I felt the wheel break. It just stopped making the little clicky sound/feeling. No trauma, no misuse, just very very very cheaply made. I surrender. It's time to cough up the money and buy the Apple brand mouse for my MacBook. My sanity is at least worth the $60.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />After three previous tries, I finally got a Bluetooth mouse for my MacBook. I'm hoping this one is sturdier than the last I purchased that barely lasted six months. That remains to be seen, but given the product materials, I'm not hopeful. Making the connection after power-up or sleep mode is a little finicky. Also, a solid flat dark surface/mouse pad seems to be a prerequisite. Without it, the cursor is slow to respond or just does its own thing. I've never seen a mouse with the jitters before, but this one will cause the cursor to jiggle and twitch, even though the mouse itself it perfectly still, untouched. I've watched the cursor jitter clear off the screen. However, using a solid black mouse pad seems to have dealt with the problem. I would send it back and try a different product, but I've sent so many cheaply made and/or mislabeled mice back to Amazon in the past month, I've got return fatigue. We'll give this one a chance with the mousepad solution.",

        "text": "I wanted something with more buttons for Hell Let Loose than the Basilik V3. This mouse is ideal for those that need extra buttons for gaming as that is the primary reason you should consider it. The thumbrest is great as I think all gaming mice should have thumbrests since it\u2019s so much better for your hand ergonomics. I have large hands and the mouse feels very good to hold and gives no fatigue. At first I though my thumb would hit the easy shift button but it didn\u2019t so that\u2019s another plus. I would say the left and right click buttons could be a bit wider and more ergonomic to say something like Basilik v3 which is where that mouse is a bit better but overall negligible. Of course the RGB is where the mouse really looks great, I love seeing so many fun colors move around and it looks really pretty to look at. So if you have a game you really like to play and are annoyed using your keyboard for some critical commands like in Hell Let Loose (map, team chat, squad chat, leadership chat) this is a very pretty, well designed convenient button placement mouse, I would recommend it.",

The software is easy to use, and it is easy to associate a game/program with a profile for auto-switching when it is run.<br /><br />I seem to use the buttons/profiles of gaming mice much more than some people.  When I read mouse reviews, they mostly talk about the weight of it and other silly things that only first person shooter people care about.  I care much more about the number/placement of extra buttons and the software used to configure the mouse.<br /><br />I have several nice mice from other brands, brought down by HORRIBLE software.  Logitech and Corsair make nice mice, but their software is a deal breaker.  Roccat's mouse software is WONDERFUL.<br /><br />I also like that the mouse has optical switches, which will last longer.<br /><br />Only downsides: Not AS MANY buttons as my Roccat LEADR (started registering the dreaded double-click fault) and the software only supports 5 profiles at once.  If you play more than 5 games that need a profile, you have to do the export/import dance.  But this is a trivial fault.<br /><br />The LEDs are a little loud, but I'm not a big LED/RGB lighting person anyway, so you can't fault the mouse.  And you can turn them off (though I tend to set the colors to identify the game, so I can make sure I'm in the correct profile.)<br /><br />Wonderful gaming mice that can be used for many different genres: MMO, FPS, etc.",

Lighter than the AIMO, similar button style but just feels smoother. Highly recommend it.",

I tried configuring them in the applications folder but never could get it right plus neither one of them was comfortable. One had a ball and the other newer one did not. Usually I really like apple products but not this time. I am happy to report this Logitech worked right out of the box after I plugged in the USB thingy. i didn't even have to set it up. I do like the roller ball. I think this mouse can do more than I know about, but am just happy it isn't changing the page I am on constantly. I got the one that was painted blue and green because it was about 6.00 cheaper than the solid colored ones. I like the design now that I have it. Since my laptop only has two USB plug ins, I bought the Amazon USB hub with three additional spots. Am happy with that too.<br />UPDATE 11-08-14<br />All of a sudden I am getting these messages saying the battery is critically low. To start with I was changing the batteries every time but it was happening way too fast so I bought a battery checker. Turns out my batteries are fine. Testing 100 %. the mouse continue to operate even though I continue receiving low battery warnings. Don't know how this is going to play out but it is the first sign of trouble. Now I just take battery out. Test it and when it continues to say 100 % I put it back in and the message goes away for a couple of days. Aggravating. I am amending star count down to 4 stars.

        "text": "I own this mouse as well as the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 now. I find them to be head to head competitors, so here's a quick comparison.<br /><br />Logitech:<br />-Somewhat of a loud click, doesn't bother me personally, but it is obviously louder<br />-The harder you flick the scroll wheel the more it'll spin. There is resistance though and I feel like it's easier to use than the Microsoft mouse.<br />-It looks cool and functionality is fine. The middle click is easy to use and the left/right of the wheel to move back or forward in a web browser works and isn't annoyingly used by accident.<br /><br />Microsoft:<br />-Quiet click and smoother sliding on the desk<br />-The wheel stops once your finger leaves it. You can't just flick and go. Scrolling seems more precise with this one, but I actually prefer the Logitech as I feel like I have more functional control with it.<br />-There is a side button that moves you backward in a web browser, the wheel left and right tilting doesn't seem to do anything.<br />-More comfortable in my hand.<br /><br />Bottom line: Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000 is smoother and more comfortable, but Logitech is more functional, especially for the middle click and scroll wheel. I was very skeptical about the benefits of this &#34;free-wheel&#34; but I love it now. If you're not a big scroll wheel and middle click enthusiast go with the Microsoft, otherwise the Logitech is for you.",

The only reason I purchased these was because I need to remove the old ones to solder in a new switch.<br /><br />With the new micro switches installed. https://amzn.to/3ElgafC ( incase you are curious which ones) and the new feet this made a whole new mouse.<br /><br />The feet arrived perfect no bends or wrinkles.  Super easy to install.  Just make sure you clean the area really good with some alcohol.<br /><br />They glide so much better than stock feet.  The feel is simply amazing.  Now whenever I purchase a new mouse I will be upgrading the feet.  If you are on the fence about it I would say go for it.<br /><br />For durability I have had these on for over a month and they have no signs of wear.  They still perform excellent.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope that it was helpful in your purchase decision",

The packaging I got the mouse and was really nice, really simple, but easy to open. The mouse was easy to set up, and the RGB looks pretty cool. There is a really cool DPI changer function that makes gaming much easier, however, I can't recommend this mouse for gaming because the ergonomics are pretty trash. I have to cramp my hand like a claw over the top of the mouse and after long periods of use it does start hurting. The surface is also pretty slippery, so I found that my hand slips on the mouse all the time. The tracking however, is great! And I would have to say that biggest plus is the battery life. I got this about 2 weeks ago, charged it once, and it is yet to die! I think the features of this mouse are great, but I would not recommend it. Purely because of the ergonomics, if you are going to use this mouse often, then you probably should go if something more ergonomic.",

I had placed a big order, 3 days after placing order, I was opening my packages, and that\u2019s counting the evening I placed my order!  I received  all my order at same time,I had to order several clothing items due to a major  weight loss because of illness!!!! Everything I have is too big for me now so I had nothing to wear and when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING!!! I had to order smaller sized clothes  so I\u2019d have some clothes to wear!! I\u2019m talking about losing 28lbs, which doctors say I\u2019m  probably not gonna gain back, maybe  5-10lbs if I\u2019m lucky!!!  All I been wearing is my pj\u2019s and yes had to order some pj\u2019s!!!!! I\u2019m normally a small, sizes 5,6,7, weight 120-125, small frame,and am 5\u20193\u201d tall. So I can\u2019t afford to lose weight esp. 28lbs which was all lost over a 4 wk period of time, I have trouble keeping weight on me anyway!! And I can\u2019t gorge myself with the foods that will make me gain weight cause I\u2019m a diabetic!! So I\u2019m in a no-win situation!!!! Thank you Amazon for giving me some cloths to wear. I ordered sizes 2-5 in slacks or jeans, small or 5-6 pj\u2019s, small or med tops, small or 5-6 lounge clothing, so I\u2019d say they are true to size at least for me they are. So hope that helps with ur sizing if u not sure!! Cause all the clothing was in that size range and I have 2  items that is to big out of all the clothing I ordered. Grouped all clothing in this review on size instead of  each individual piece of clothing!!! So go with ur size u are changing to and Amazon measurements to make sure and by looking at my before and after size, weight that should get u right on size u need to order.",

I wear women's gloves size S, and this fits my hands really well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The click. I have a thing with clicks. It's maddening to hear yourself click loudly all day. If the click were silent, this would be the perfect mouse. Maybe I'm a little neurotic, but it's distracting for me.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- The LED light near your thumb is small. I don't know why so many of mice have light strips. It seems like something else to use up the battery. I'd prefer to not have any lights, outside of what's necessary underneath for a track light. Not a big deal, and better than most.<br /><br />Other:<br />- Made In China<br />- 6D Optical Mouse<br />- Takes 2 AAA Batteries",

        "text": "It seems like a lot of oral care companies are now going more high end, as I am starting to see toothpaste for over $10 when you can get \"normal\" toothpaste at the drugstore for $1-$2 (with a coupon). I was drawn to this because it is fluoride free. The toothpaste is nice and minty fresh, my mouth felt clean and fresh afterwards. I know that the brownish colored toothpaste may bother some people but I have used herbal toothpaste before so no color is \"weird\" or off limits for me - as long as they taste fine. There's even a few brands out there that has black colored paste! I really like the mouthwash as well and I'm surprised it is alcohol free because I feel like it does as good of a job as an alcohol one that I just recently purchased - minus the burn. My mouth just smelled and felt amazing after using both. I wasn't as fond of the dental gel as I found it useless and not something I would want to use much of. Overall this is a very nice set of oral care products and I would highly recommend the toothpaste and the mouth wash. I personally would repurchase the toothpaste and mouthwash - I hope they have a set with just those two items.",

I also prefer firm toothbrushes and picked these specifically because they were marked as \"super hard\" - and they really do live up to the name, because they were actually a little too hard for me. (I suspect I was brushing too hard since I'm used to different types of brushes, so it's just something I have to get used to.)

        "text": "[[VIDEOID:d99e4c11dd05411b9b597ceb102b22f]] Update: For some reason mine stopped turning on even after I fully charged it. However, customer service was excellent! I reached out to them on Amazon and they immediately sent me a replacement which arrived in 2 days. I am very happy with their level of customer service, in addition to this still being one of the best electronic toothbrush I've used. It really just makes my mouth feel so clean, more than the Philips one ever did. The replacement set that I received has one toothbrush head that emits blue light, and one that emits red light. In my previous set there were only blue light heads so I'm happy I finally get to try the red light. I am currently using this with a whitening gel paste from another brand and it works wonderfully. I am waiting for Sparx to come out with toothpaste (fluoride free please!) and whitening paste. Bottom line: great customer service, great product, and still highly recommend Sparx!<br /><br />I really like this toothbrush and it really makes me want to brush my teeth more frequently. I have to admit I sometimes get lazy to brush my teeth but this one makes me look forward to my night time routine. I already have an electric toothbrush at home but this one caught my eye because of the LED blue light. I just had to get it because I was curious about this feature.<br /><br />In terms of the brush power, I think it is great. There are different modes - clean, white, polish, and gum care. Each one vibrates in a different manner. I like that the button is big because if I want to change modes mid brush, my thumb can find it easily. I've used other electric toothbrushes where the power button is so small I couldn't really find it with my thumb. The overall design and size of the button, toothbrush head, and body is perfect, at least for me.<br /><br />This does use a proprietary brush head, which currently comes in a 1 or 2 pack. It is cheaper to get the 2 pack. I am currently using the blue light version. I believe if you want the red light you'll have to purchase a different brush head. The set I got is both blue light brush heads, so there were two replaceable brush heads in the box. I believe some of their other sets comes with one blue and one red. There is a small charging stand which will need to be plugged into an outlet for the toothbrush to charge.<br /><br />My only confusion with this product is how the blue light works. Will it work with my own toothpaste or does it require Sparx branded toothpaste? Does the light works to whiten teeth regardless if you use toothpaste or not? Is the LED blue light safe to use on skin? That is the only part that I needed more clarification on, and wished there was more information on this Amazon page.<br /><br />Regardless of my questions, I still think this is a great electric toothbrush with a lot of potential. My teeth feels so clean after use.",

As a sonic toothbrush it works well but there are other options out there that are less expensive that don't require specialized replacement heads.  It is nice that this charges using an USB interface so that saves on cords when traveling.  It is generally not clear how the blue light is supposed to help.  Looking up teeth whitening technology it appears you need a special gel for the blue light to activate teeth whitening.  This is not included with the toothbrush nor discussed in the literature that I can find.  Overall, this works well as a sonic toothbrush, but you will need to purchase special teeth whitening gel to gain the benefits of the blue light as I don't really see a difference by itself.",

I bought this one because of the larger water reservoir.<br /><br />The first time I went to use it I was ready to give it 1 star. It was terrible. No water came out and my troubleshooting efforts left me nothing but frustrated. I tossed it back in the box to try again when I was less annoyed.<br /><br />Then I tried again and love it. I don\u2019t know what worked differently, but it\u2019s worked well since the first time. Maybe it needed to get cursed at a few times to warm up. The flosser has different settings so you can pick what\u2019s right for you. I liked the pulse setting because it seemed to leave me with less of that annoying water flosser spray that seems inevitable no matter how careful I am.<br /><br />I didn\u2019t love the toothbrush, and the water+toothbrush setting just seemed to be a mess with no actual flossing effect. I don\u2019t intend to use this for brushing, but it will definitely replace my old water flosser.",

It was messy on my first try as shown on the attached pic! I used the external water for the flosser and wasn't able to properly attached the flosser. I finally was able to  manage it on my subsequent attempts.  Although you can choose the different modes of output, the pressure of the water is a bit strong. I'm not sure if you can adjust the pressure. If you have sensitive gums or teeth, expect a little bleeding. Overall, this  is a great home product which I recommend!",

An electric toothbrush makes the tedious job of brushing your teeth a lot easier. The unit has numinous settings to (my favorite is pulse) allow you to select the best for your style of brushing. The head is relatively small so it can get all the way to your back teeth with ease. The real bonus is the water flosser feature. The first time tried it I ended up spraying the mirror and getting water everywhere since. Once i got the hang of it it felt good to use it in conjunction with he brush.  At first I couldn't figure out with the additional hose set was for. So I went back to the instructions and realized that it was for those times when I was out of my house so I could water floss.",

It made perfect sense to have a device that flushes out the spaces between your teeth while you brush.  Unfortunately, while this model combines the two functions, it doesn't do either function as well as the individual devices do on their own.  The vibrating toothbrush function is ok but not great.  The water flosser doesn't feel like it has the same power or precision (even on the highest setting) as my stand alone water flosser.  Also, the hose that connects the water flosser to the brush kinks very easily (especially if you use anything but warm water) so it's difficult to maneuver around your mouth without it stopping because the hose bent too much.<br />If I had never owned a vibrating toothbrush or a water flosser before I might think this was an awesome device but I was really hoping for more.",

It has several different speeds for brushing teeth, gums, tongue, etc.  By default, the light will blink and the toothbrush pause at certain intervals to ensure you spend enough time brushing different areas. This can be further customized with the Bluetooth unit and application. This is a neat novelty, and may be good for encouraging children to learn to brush correctly. To be honest though, when in a rush in the morning, I am not likely to take the extra step of using a phone app while brushing my teeth, and I also prefer not to take up another plug, as it\u2019s not integrated with the charging base.<br /><br />Overall I like the toothbrush a lot, but next time around, I would likely get the less expensive model without the phone accessories.",

She suggested a softer brush head for my Sonicare and to never supplement with hand brushing if the electric brush is available.<br /><br />These brush heads fit the newer models of Philips Sonicare but I don't know about older models.

I do like that this head tells me when to swap out (C1 doesn\u2019t) but $15 for a replacement is steep considering my toothbrush was $30.

It still does involve technology as the toothbrush has a display that yields information, such as how long you've been brushing and other messages on your performance. The real feature though is that the toothbrush has a blue sensor in it which you use to connect to an app which gets information on how long you brushed, which areas, if you pressed the brush too hard on your teeth or gums, etc., and spits out a brushing report.<br /><br />We thought moving to an electric toothbrush would motivate our daughter to brush more a few years ago, and it did, but the results were limited. As she's 8, and at an age where she's really becoming a bookworm, she likes reading the brushing reports and it motivates her to brush herself.<br /><br />As I said the brush is manual, and obviously the bristles will wear down with time, so the head of the brush is detachable and can be replaced for $3.50 for a set of 2 (price as of January 9, 2023). Obviously, you don't want to buy a whole new brush with technology in it every time the bristles get weaker.<br /><br />I'm glad this one is getting my daughter to understand to brush correctly and she wants to do it regularly to see how she's doing.",

Sonicare technology gently pulses water between your teeth, for a month's worth of manual brushing in just 2 minutes. The QuadPacer lets you know when you've spent the optimal amount of time on each section of your mouth while the SmarTimer signals when your 2 minutes is up. The pressure sensor flashes red to remind you to ease off, helping to prevent gum recession, while the 2 intensity settings ensure a comfortable clean that\u2019s right for you. Going electric might feel like a big step, but with this brush you\u2019re in safe hands. Its slim ergonomic design and familiar-shaped head gives you everything you need for an effective clean. The kit includes 1 Philips Sonicare 4100 electric toothbrush, 1 Optimal Plaque Control (C2) brush head and 1 USB charger (wall adaptor not included). An additional 3 pack of Optimal Plaque Control (C2) brush heads included.",

        "text": "First off, this toothbrush is so pretty. I ordered the Green, which is really a deep turquoise with attractive, shiny gold accents. It's lightweight but feels substantial, not at all cheap. It also comes with a whopping eight (8) brush heads, which is enough for 2 years. Amazing. I also really like the brush size. Many brushes are too big for adequate brushing, but this is a really nice size. The bristles are not overly stiff, so they don't irritate my gums.<br /><br />Everything with this brush is powered by a single button, pushed multiple times to change modes and held down to turn off manually. Clean mode lasts 2 minutes with a pause every 30 seconds to change quadrants before finally turning off on its own. Additional modes are Polish (I googled to discover that this helps remove stains and shine teeth post brushing), Milder (for sensitive teeth), White (whitening), and Gum Care/Massage. Obviously, the vibration makes a sound, but it's on par with the loudness of other electric toothbrushes I have used<br /><br />A really nice feature is that this does not require a separate charging base. The charging cord is built right into the base (which means you cannot lose it) and accessed by twisting and removing the gold piece at the bottom, and it plugs into any USB port. When charging is complete, the USB sticks back into a slot, and the base twists back on. A full charge is expected to last 45 days, though I haven't had it long enough to know if that pans out yet!<br /><br />Overall, this is a high-quality electric toothbrush that has everything you could possibly need. I'm really happy with it.",

When it is charging, it blinks red and then goes to solid red when fully charged.  It comes with 8 brushes and has 5 settings. It took me a little bit to get used to because it vibrates more than any toothbrush I have ever used.  I guess that is why it is called a sonic toothbrush.  After using it several times I am now used to it, and it does do a very good job at cleaning my teeth.  I have been using it about a week and so far, I only charged it the one time.",

        "title": "Great for Sensitive Gums and Teeth",
        "text": "I was told by my dentist to switch toothbrushes from manual to Oral-B electric toothbrush because it stops brushing when you brush too hard and keeps your enamel in tact, which helps relieve sensitive teeth. The dentist also recommended Oral-B because it was a good price point and has great features like a timer for 2 minutes and gets really close to the gum to get rid of icky plaque. Since I have been using Oral-B, he has noticed that I no longer have any plaque build up between cleanings and my sensitive teeth are gone. He also says my teeth look whiter and brighter. I love the toothbrush because it is light and easy to hold and get to those hard to reach places in the back of your mouth. It also leaves your teeth feeling extremely clean compared to a manual toothbrush. I can never go back to a regular toothbrush now because I tried on vacation once and felt absolutely disgusting in comparison. Oral-B is definitely the way to go for a clean mouth feel!<br /><br />mouthwashes to ACT Restoring because it restores enamel that is weak and will alleviate sensitivity and use Glide Comfort Floss. Boy, was she correct. After just a few days of using the mouthwash I no longer feel that uncomfortable sensation on my teeth. I also am no longer needing prescription strength toothpaste. I now use this mouthwash twice daily and floss once a day, in combination with Sensodyne's Repair and Protect toothpaste. My gums do not bleed when I floss and I don't dread flossing. Glide floss goes easily between even the tightest teeth and has a lovely mint flavor that helps freshen breath at the same time. Changing the floss and mouthwash have made a huge improvement and now I can eat hot or cold foods without wincing in pain.",

The brush twisting gets my kids more into brushing their teeth but when I am brushing, the brush itself doesn't lock into place as as you are going around in their mouth and moving your hand it twists and doesn't stay in place. So I am typically adjusting at least once mid brush. Usually my kiddos are good about brushing but they have their days so its those days its really an issue for me.

        "text": "[[VIDEOID:be0e9ab7d6ac2bbe6f1a5308058bc84a]] I have tried other electric toothbrushes but this one exceeded my expectations. My teeth felt clean and I love the built in timers. No more second guessing if you have brushed long enough with this one.<br /><br />The toothbrush has a great battery life. It took several hours to fully charge but once the light indicator turned from red to green; I haven\u2019t had to charge it again. I have brushed my teeth more than 6 times and the battery is still going strong.<br /><br />Another great feature is the ability to choose cleaning speeds and (cleaning and whitening) modes with the push of a button. I really enjoyed the high frequency clean mode. When I use this toothbrush, my teeth and tongue feels amazing day and night.<br /><br />And finally, I was delighted to get 5 refill brush tips. The brush tips have a small profile making it easier to brush my wisdom teeth and the bristles are gentle to my gums. This is a great toothbrush with so many features making it a good value for about $30.",

I have not needed to charge this thing since I got it, and that was weeks ago.<br />I love all the color combos that goes with this. There\u2019s black, pink, white\u2026 so you can actually blend it in with your bathroom decor.<br />I opted for the black because our new granite tops are very dark in color.<br />There are a bunch of attachments that I might never use, but appreciate!<br />And for this price?! This is an awesome price point. You can\u2019t go wrong with this rechargeable tooth brush.",

The head of the cute bear prevents the toothbrush piece from going too far into the baby's mouth but it is still long enough to act as a teether and also massage the gums. Babies usually do not start getting teeth until about 6 months so it can help the child get used to the first steps of \"brushing their teeth.\" The current price of $12.99 ($15.99 minus $3) is a bit pricey for this.<br /><br />Always supervise during use and be careful to clean this regularly. Because the brush area is grooved, it is important to give this a vigorous cleaning in that area as food, lint, etc. can get caught in that area depending on where the baby puts it.",

        "text": "My vet advised me to brush my cats' teeth at least 3x a week. They haven't liked the typical toothbrushes used for this, so I decided to try these. They tolerate these brushes really well and even seem to enjoy the \"massage\" these brushes give them. I have two cats so it was great that these came in a two-pack so each gets their own toothbrush. They work well with the \"cat toothpaste\" I use and I haven't had any issues with the little silicone bristles coming off like the bristles on other types of toothbrushes. It slips over my finger and fits perfectly - just snug enough that I have good control, which is imperative for brushing pet teeth, and it also gives some protection in case of biting. This hasn't been an issue for me, since my cats are young and are used to having their teeth brushed at this point. The key to successful tooth brushing for cats is starting slow and being consistent. Glad to have found these, because they really do make the process a lot easier and I'm able to get the job done a lot faster and with less fuss from my fur babies. I'm also more confident that these can be kept cleaner than a typical toothbrush due to being made of silicone because the last thing you want is to spread more bacteria around! Would definitely buy these again when they wear out, but they seem durable enough that they will last for years.",

I've been skeptical about using the cotton baby toothbrushes because I don't want any lint staying in my baby's mouth or it slipping off and be a potential choking hazard. This silicone toothbrush fits perfectly on my finger and makes it so much easier to brush his teeth rather than using a toothbrush and worrying about scraping the roof of his mouth. It's soft all around and has a silicone brush side to brush and a bumpy side for better gum stimulation. It comes in a pack of two and this brand has various modern colors. I highly recommend this product for infant brushing!",

        "text": "I was so excited to get my new toothbrush in the mail today but have been trying for the last 30 minutes to get the thing opened so batteries can be installed & it is next to impossible. It has a \u201copen to install\u201d & close, I have turned it to \u201copen to install\u201d it will not open, have even tried to pry it open with a knife to no avail. Instruction booklet does not touch battery installation. If I could get the batteries in - I\u2019d probably LOVE the toothbrush, as it seems to be well made & comes with a tongue scraper/brush & 2 toothbrush heads. Purchased for autistic grandson who has trouble brushing his teeth, hoping to make things easier for his little life but this mimi is getting extra frustrated with the little \u201cno grip\u201d cap that won\u2019t open for battery installation. Now have to go through the dreaded process of processing a return. On a good note, if you\u2019re purchasing it for someone who is severely disabled - you won\u2019t have to worry about them popping the battery compartment open & choking on the batteries because it \u201cain\u2019t happening\u201d as we say in the south. ***Update to review. Customer service is awesome. Made 1 phone call & they\u2019ve called me back twice & sending a new system with preinstalled batteries. The one I got, must\u2019ve been a fluke. Now updated to a 5star. Very well made. Has a 2 minute timer on it that can be set for children or someone with intellectual disability so they brush teeth for right amount of time. Nice system & wonderul customer service.",

The design seems a bit wasteful/odd, as the handle is quite thick and sturdy but rather short. It is hard for me to keep my grip as I brush because the handle is so short, and my hands are not even that big. I feel like I don't get as good of a cleaning/scrubbing because of the short handle. I think the manufacturer could make the handle a little less thick, but longer. I think it would be more effective if that were the case. Also, the taste is pretty bland and it doesn't leave a \"fresh\" taste (like a fresh minty taste) in my mouth. I know my teeth are probably clean, but it just doesn't feel or taste like I'm getting as good of a cleaning as I do with my regular-sized toothbrush and minty toothpaste. For a one or two day trip, they would be fine, but for anything longer, I'd want to bring a standard toothbrush.",

It really works.<br />Of course I had to figure out how to use it in a way that better suits me.<br />Best Way to use it: When you feel that canker coming on in your mouth....dry that area as much as possible. Use either a cotton ball or a tissue to dry the surface area where the sore is. The dryer the spot, the better contact you can make with the Kank-A SoftBrush Tooth/Mouth Pain Gel, Apply the gel directly to your canker sore and give it a little time to actually start drying on the sore. Sometimes you do have to sit there with your tongue out- but if you want to treat it fast and get the gel into the sore better, its worth it. Once the gel is pretty much set in, you can go back to your normal routine. You will have to reapply it a few times a day.<br />For the best maximum treatment and results, put it on your Canker right before going to sleep. The gel will have time to work its magic while you sleep...totally recommend using this.",

        "text": "I've been trying a bunch of similar toothbrushes lately.  First off, most of the brands do not have interchangeable heads, so many of these will end up getting thrown out once the heads are used.  For that reason, getting 8 heads with this is an important feature, because at least for the current price, you could hardly buy 8 disposable brushes.<br /><br />One of the things I like about some others is when they have an induction charger that also acts like a little dock (of those, I prefer the ones with a USB plug rather than an AC plug).  Those normally charge a premium, but this one is inexpensive, so at least they have that going for it.  It's not like you have to charge it often (although definitely more than once a year), but laying a toothbrush down to plug it in is cumbersome, and it takes a while to charge.<br /><br />I don't want or need the 30/120 second timers, but every single one I've ever seen (of the \"sonic\" type) has had that, so how can I complain?  I end up brushing for 6-10 minutes most of the time.<br /><br />Not a bad version of the less expensive off-brand options, but I don't think anyone can predict the future as to if and for how long replacement heads will be available.",

    "description": "Our kids plain toothbrush is perfect for little ones who are just learning to brush their teeth. The bristles are of the same stiffness as our \u201cx-soft\u201d adult model but instead of 47 tufts, they have just 24 tufts. Though we call it our \u201ckids\u201d brush, many adults actually like the control they have with the smaller cleaning surface that this brush provides. 4 toothbrushes per pack. This is NOT a flimsy \"disposable\" style toothbrush. It is a quality, x-soft-bristle toothbrush with a solid handle like you grew up with. All the bristles are at the same level for the most even cleaning capability. Compare to the older style GUM, Colgate and Just the Basics from CVS brands. No crazy \"ergonomic\" handles. No multi-color bristles. No varying-length bristles. No bent heads. Just a well-made classic toothbrush! Because the Sound Feelings toothbrush has a traditional flat top, it actually makes better surface contact with all surfaces within your mouth than \"modern\" multilevel brushes.\" All toothbrushes are INDIVIDUALLY-WRAPPED in cellophane for maximum sterility. Certified BPA-free, Phthalate-free. Please search on Amazon for ALL VERSIONS of our toothbrushes from Sound Feelings: Soft, Extra Soft, Medium, Hard, Extra-Hard and Kids, or Sampler, if you aren't sure.",

However, after trying these, I prefer the flip top holders better because they are more streamlined, have an air vent for drying the brush, and are easier to operate.<br /><br />These look nice on the brush but there is no air vent. The only air circulation is through the bottom hole through which the handle feeds through. Also, the act of opening the clip is cumbersome. Sometimes these almost want to fly out of my hand. In addition, they flop around on the top of the brush and take up more space. For instance, if I had a six-toothbrush holder and wanted to cover the top of every brush, I really could not do that successfully with these because they are top large and would be hitting into each other.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these do what they are supposed to do except they are not my favorite.<br /><br />The current price of $17.99 is an expensive $3 per holder.",

That was so easy and fast and you got a good brushing of your teeth.  The bristles are charcoal infused bristle and this adds to completely clean your teeth and makes them feel clean.<br /><br />I am wondering what one has to do if battery is used up as could not figure out where to change a battery.

It's a Hikers Find. I would Recommend these, and they are a little cheaper than Dirty Girl Gaiters. I am considering another purchase in the future, as I feel having more than one pair to change out the dirty ones in between laundering is a smart move. The patterns are limited and also color choices, but it's functionality is whats more important! I haven't put them on trail or hiking as of yet, but I intend to in the future!",

    "description": "This vinyl decal is made of high quality indoor/outdoor rated and proven Oracal 651 vinyl!! -These are perfect for car windows, skateboards, Ipads, etc. (Practically any smooth, clean surface) -A vinyl cut sticker means that there is no background or clear backing. Only the image is the adhesive part! -These are not Cling-ons. -Please apply only to a clean, dry surface. Below are some instructions on how to apply these cool stickers: Step 1 Rub the sticker with a credit card or something with a rigid surface to be sure the transfer tape is properly adhered to the sticker. Step 2 Clean and dry the desired area. Stickers will stick best to clean smooth surfaces. Step 3 Remove the paper backing slowly making sure the sticker stays adhered to the transparent transfer tape Step 4 Carefully position the sticker to the desired area. Once the sticker sticks it will be nearly impossible to reposition without destroying the sticker. Rub the sticker from one side to the other, eliminating any air bubbles. Step 5 Use a hard edged object like a credit card to make sure the entire sticker is fully adhered to the surface. Step 6 Slowly remove the transfer tape. Making sure no part of the sticker remains on the transfer tape. Step 7 Check for air bubbles. In most cases air bubbles can be worked to the edge of the sticker, but if not, a pin hole will allow the air out and become virtually invisible, once the bubble is gone. That\u2019s it! Your sticker is now worry free. It will last through rain, sleet, snow and gentle washing's. You can remove the sticker from glass surfaces with a razor blade or in most cases a fingernail will get the removal process started.",

    "description": "There is no background color. The surface that you apply the sticker to will become your background color. This will be a single color sticker. This is a DIE-CUT vinyl decal meaning that the background has been trimmed off. If there is a background color in the picture, it is used only as a representation. The background color will be the surface color you place the sticker on (or clear if you put it on a window). The decal will come with clear transfer tape, so you can easily apply it to anything you like (walls, windows, cars, mailbox, mirrors, laptops, etc etc etc). I use PREMIUM Oracal brand vinyl for all decals. Application is relatively easy. Your decal will come as THREE pieces - the backing paper, the sticker itself, and the clear transfer tape. Make sure you are applying to a CLEAN surface. You carefully pull the clear transfer tape up from the backing paper, making sure that it pulls the sticker up with it (if it does not, then firmly press down on it with a squee-gee or credit card or something similar until it sticks properly to the clear transfer tape). Then you apply the sticker and clear transfer tape to whatever surface you would like the decal on. You then use a squee-gee or credit card or something similar to firmly press down once again, making sure that the sticker STICKS, and then you carefully and slowly remove the clear transfer tape from the top, leaving behind only the sticker. I have found that on some surfaces (especially walls and wood surfaces), it helps to leave the clear transfer tape on for awhile to make sure everything is sticking well before removing it. I do not issue refunds or exchanges on vinyl decals. Please understand this before you bid. Some decals are more difficult to apply than others (especially the little ones!) - likewise, some surfaces are more difficult to apply decals to.",

They don't replace a flashlight, but they do light up a fair amount of the path that I wouldn't otherwise see with my small flashlight.  I've smacked them against car doors and chair rails a few times, and they've stayed solidly on my feet and are no worse for wear.  They are great for visibility for others too - your feet move a lot, and so do these lights.  Add flashing and you're much more visible either walking or on a bicycle.  I think they'd also be great for camping, and maybe at a dance party (flashing feet might be fun!)  My only thought is that they seem a little pricey, but they are one of the few that go on shoe laces and not just popping into holes in Crocs.  They're quite sturdy and battery life is great too.",

I'm undecided on if these are really bright enough to be practical... is there a light - yes. Is it going to replace a flashlight - absolutely not.

I've always loved New Balance for making wider shoes in the first place, but  these extra wide walking shoes are great. That's why I always go back to NB. They are not made as solid as before as these fabrics do tend to tear, make a hole on the big toe side, usually. But these fit great (size fit as expected), and breathes well.",

This updated version combines advanced components with a striking new design that honors Tokyo's heritage. The GEL-KAYANO 26 shoe allows you to tackle long distances in comfort, thanks to the rearfoot GEL technology that's been redesigned for improved shock absorption upon impact. You'll also benefit from a bouncy feel that stems from the FLYTEFOAM Propel midsole technology. The DUOMAX technology in the midsole offers better support and helps resist excessive overpronation while I.G.S. technology promotes smoother propulsion. Additionally, this style is accented with reflective detailing to improve your visibility when running in low light settings. Get the inspiration and support you need to smash your training goals in the special edition GEL-KAYANO 26 Retro Tokyo performance running shoe from ASICS.",

        "text": "I own more pairs of shoes right now that at any time in my life. Part of the reason is because I am involved in more activities than I was in the past and I am thus in need of more types of shoes. My desire to diversify further led me to get my feet inside a pair of INZCOU Men's Non-Slip Gym Sneakers.<br /><br />I\u2019ve owned lots of pairs of sneakers, but this is the first time I have owned sneakers that do not have a tongue. Instead, these shoes are slip- on and that makes them a little easier to put on because you don\u2019t have to reach down and pull the tongue out, like you commonly do with other shoes. Once they are slipped into place, you tie and are ready to go.<br /><br />These shoes fit about as expected. The only small issue I had was with the arch support in one of the shoes- it seemed a little off and it hurt at first. But after walking around for a while, everything is fine now. And since these are the first pair of black sneakers I have ever owned, they match up nicely with my darker jeans. It\u2019s a welcome change from the white sneakers I usually wear.<br /><br />It\u2019s good to have a variety of shoes and INZCOU sneakers have proven a good addition to my collection. I will still wear traditional sneakers, the type that doesn\u2019t slip on. But I am happy to add this set of sneakers to my growing supply.",

Didn't damage the shoes when removing it and with care I was able to put it back in.<br /><br />So in conclusion, yes these are amazing shoes if you need some overpronation support or if your gait is neutral. In this case I'd highly recommend but sadly it didn't work for me. The shoes look amazing and they feel amazing. The price with the construction of the shoes is an amazing value if you just need some extra support and cushion. I'd consider this shoe to be plush in the midsole and the insole was comfortable but not a lot to make it heavy. If it weren't for my arch I would of ordered another shoe to keep in storage when this one wears out. Great service as usual from Amazon for the free return.",

Started seeing Xero Shoes pop up on social media and YouTube. I looked them for months and it seemed like a gimmick product. After some time I said ok I am going to try this shoe and see if they meet their hype. In July of this year I ordered the Prio Cross Trainer model. Now their instructions said adjust over a couple of weeks. Well I said hell no and put them to the test right out of the box. I wore them every chance I got for 30 days straight. I found them comfortable right out of the box and I did not experience any foot or leg discomfort during the break period. I began liking them the more I wore them. At day 31 I put my Brooks Adrenaline runners on. Within 15 mins I was aware of how unbalanced I was in that shoe and while walking around in my home said, I can\u2019t wear these any more I have to put my Xero Shoes on. I swear I referred to them specifically. I have since purchased 2 pairs of the HFS model runners and they are my favorite shoe. I wear them every day. In my old shoes at the end of the day I would change to my slides, I literally have these on until I go to bed. Closest thing to walking barefoot and still having a shoe on.",

I cannot imagine who would find them wearable.  Maybe someone with abnormally narrow feet.<br /><br />The VERY stretchy material they are made from makes them hard to get on. You MUST use a shoehorn, and even then, it is not easy.  They also - unpleasantly - squeeze the foot.  After an hour, my toes are getting cold from low circulation! Seriously! Plus, the material does not breathe well, despite it's \"perforated\" appearance.  So my feet are hot and wet.<br /><br />The laces are just decoration.  It's the tight material that holds them on.  Plus, the artsy-craftsy arch inset in the instep is an invitation to soiling underneath it, without giving much arch support.<br />Could these be knock-offs?  I assumed the attractive price was because they are a discontinued color.  Maybe they are just fakes!.<br /><br />PS  THESE ARE NOT FOR DIABETICS.

I would have given the Ghost 5 stars, but the Ghost 14 is not quite perfect, having two areas where it could be better (and was better previously).<br /><br />The first picture shows a Ghost 14 (on the left), next to a Ghost 13 (the previous model, on the right), and you can see the Ghost 14 has less tread, so wears out sooner, I would say roughly 50-75 miles of road (asphalt) running.  The picture shows both shoes new.  The Ghost 13 also was a little more cushioned, but you can offset that some by putting a different insole in the 14, and a lot of runners replace the insoles anyway.  The thinner tread means less mileage on the 14s, but still probably as good as most of the competition, just no longer better here.<br /><br />The second pictures shows the upper collar on a Ghost 14, and the fabric Brooks is using there (not so much on the 13 and earlier models) is nice and soft, but does not hold up.  I generally see holes or failures at the top of the lace area, and on some shoes, towards the back collar area.  You get a lot of fraying, sometimes holes, which is more an appearance problem than anything that would impact running in them, but means also you cannot wear them casually, at least where someone might see the failures.  That may be an aspect that is supply chain related, they used to hold up better,  but I have seen the problem on two pair of Ghost 14s, and other manufacturers do a bit better (probably needs a bit more nylon, to hold up longer).<br /><br />I will say that the Ghost 14 has a narrower tongue at the top, that is shared with the 13 but was new there, and I have not seen it much in other shoes, but actually works very well, so I give kudos to Brooks on that design innovation.  There is less chance that during a run the tongue will shift over into the forefoot, at least in a painful way, and you don't have to stop to shift it back.<br /><br />So overall, particularly at this price point, the Brooks continues to be good value and one of the top shoes to consider, but as with anything, there are a couple of areas that could use further improvement.",

Ok, so I am ashamed to wear them with jeans and a tee, I tried them for everyday but couldn't get over what I'll call the &#34;dad sneakers&#34; look. But I took these for a run and wow! They're very comfortable. A little clunky but flexible enough for daily training and the cushion is just right for me, sightly on the plush side but not squishy. These are my new daily runners. I don't know how long they'll last, but for the price, if I get 200 miles, I'll be happy.<br /><br />Also, if you're a 3e/4e and you like or need a wide toe box, these will deliver. I'm a smaller 4e but i need a wide toe box, especially since I'm not willing to give up my injinji toe socks. These are very spacious with plenty of room for my toe splay.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Original review: From the product pictures I wasn't sure if I'd like them or hate them. But for the price I figured I might as well try them. They fit nicely, have moderate cushion, and they're more flexible than I expected. They're basic sneakers, no bells or whistles. But they're comfortable enough I would try running in them. They're certainly not fashion forward, but I wouldn't be ashamed to wear them with jeans and a tee. And if you're looking for extra-wide these fit like a true 4e. I expected to hate them but I'm pleasantly surprised and I'll probably keep them and use they for everyday sneakers or runners.",

Improved guidance line\u00ae technology harmoniously syncs componentry to embrace the motions of the runner gait cycle.\nIn 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",

I was hooked as I tried them on.  They are the most comfy shoe I ever used, better than any Nike air, better than the walking co. store orthopedic shoes.  These were just super soft.  The size is what I usually wear if there is no wide version.<br /><br />Seem breathable, I got the navy blue with orange trims.  I think it looks fine, not into the flashy color.  I switch to office shoes when I am in the office.<br /><br />The only issue is the price is very high.  This is my first ever new balance, I always thought they were just another running shoe brand, but man the fresh foam is the most cloud-like soles.  I only had it for a few weeks, so not sure how long they will last.  I usually wear Merrell an outdoor brand, they don't seem to last very long tho.",

My coworkers are spending $150 or more on HOKA and I got these cheeeeap!! I love them!!!! Plus, when it rains they don't squeak????? I was so surprised, I don't know what to say about that. The heel is see thru and there isn't even any water inside after washing them. Sized very accurate, if anything they were 1/2 inch longer than expected. I wear a 7.5 in womens U.S. and these are not tight AT ALL, if I had gotten an 8, which I normally do when buying online and especially foreign, I would have been in trouble. Get them! I am getting another color as soon as I finish typing.",

        "text": "First things First.  I received this as a review item in exchange for an unbiased review. I have an 11 M foot (US) and while I wasn't overly crazy about the color, I realized they matched a lot of my race wear.  So I decided to give them a try.  The first run was a little tough but that's always the case (If you're new to running, trust me, don't run your first race without adequately breaking in your shoes). After about 15 miles I started to really like them.<br /><br />So, you see the colors.  I personally always buy the clip on laces which I did butI've probably got well over 60 miles on them now and while I'm pretty loyal to another brand (which is also costs substantially more) I will definitely be picking up another pair.<br /><br />If you are a heel striker (work on your form before you suffer the consequences of it) these have ample cusioning in the back - but take a friendly word of advice, instead of getting into bad form.  These are great shoes to improve your form with and once you have it, the extra padding in the back is not impediment.  They are very light and fit well once worn in.  I'm not trilled about the simultaneously yet cool look they have but so is life.  You don't buy running shoes to look cool unless you're a poster you buy them for performance and these deliver.<br /><br />Again I'm speaking to new runners and people that aren't that familiar with the sport. You don't want to have one pair you wear every day. They'll develop a wear pattern and it's not good. Instead buy at least two, ideally a few and alternate so that this happens at a much slower pace. From my experience, three pairs of shoes worn on alternating days will last much longer than one pair bought three times.  And this is important b/c unless you're working on bearfoot running (which seems to still be a raging philosophical battle in the podiatric communities) you'll want support, comfort and stability. As a digression, I've tried barefoot running and it fundamentally changed the way I ran, until I stepped on a piece of glass and my right foot had yet to harden.<br /><br />Again at the risk of lecturing remember that injuries are one of the biggest enemies to progress. You could easily run through broken glass on these and probably right over some smaller nails (I'm not advising it, just pointing it out).  Styling aside I love these and will be picking up another pair or two in the near future.",

        "text": "Received my new running shoes about 15 minutes ago from Amazon.  I was excited to use these shoes on a run and tried them on.  I have a narrow foot and wear an 11 in New Balance (based on 3 pairs of shoes), and every other brand except Salomon and Saucony that run small.  Well, these run small, really small.  My toe was touching the end of the shoe, and these were very tight and hard to get on (I have a narrow foot!).  These are lightweight, look good, and appear to be somewhat well made.  The soles look like they are cheaper foam, and don't really have a running shoe tread.  Not sure how long they would last, but at the under forty dollar price when marked down, not a bad deal.  I would expect to get at least 200 miles on pavement running out of these.",

Our rear foot and forefoot gel cushioning systems are now even more adaptive, assisting mild to moderate over pronators alike with greater support, while the fluid ride midsole offers the ultimate ride.\nIn 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness.

I over-pronate pretty badly and this shoe offers great support for that issue; My knees thank me. I found the shoe to fit exactly true to size and for those reviews that say it's small, people tend to forget that your feet swell when you run, especially longer distances! My personal size foot is between a 6.5-7 and I typically wear a 7 shoe for running, dress, or sandals. I can't say I know the difference between the GT-2000 model numbers (1-5?) except for new-ness. I have no issue with wearing older models and like the cheaper prices. For reference, I run half marathons several times a year on city sidewalks, asphalt, dirt roads, and dirt trails.",
