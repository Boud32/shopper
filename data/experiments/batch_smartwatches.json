        "text": "This generally works well enough for exercise purposes. I didn't get the \"dangerous app warning\" on my iPhone, though I did get a warning that if I use the watch to display messages, then the app has access to all my contacts and the text of all my messages. I doubt I'm a target for Chinese spying so I chose to ignore that, but it's still worth noting.<br /><br />I love that it's waterproof, other watch faces are available (though I couldn't figure out how to restore the original, more-helpful one without doing a full factory reset), it tracks steps and sleep, plus it's able to measure heartrate and blood pressure. Mine sometimes tells me the weather, but only immediately after connecting to my Google account on my phone; otherwise it just says \"unknown\" (and honestly, if I have to click extra buttons on my phone, I can just check the weather there). It has a music playback control, but I couldn't get that to work. It also theoretically connects to my phone and lets me enter a phone number, but I couldn't click \"dial\" so that bit felt more like a child's toy, where you pretend to call a phone but don't actually do it. But since I use this for exercise more than connectivity, I'm OK with that.<br /><br />Some things are less than stellar, like their heart rate screen always shows a default chart (I don't think it ever lets you create your own heart rate chart)... and it shows a heartrate from 120-150 ALWAYS, which catches me off guard when I've been sitting at my desk for 2 hours. But I learned it's just a concept; there is no real *graph of my heartrate that I can find, just current / min / max that I can see from my phone. Or I can click \"measure\" to get my instant heartrate on my phone (good while exercising). Blood pressure can sometimes be measured from your phone (though it takes 1-4 minutes for some reason), and sometimes that screen disappears completely; I haven't yet figured out the pattern<br /><br />It doesn't seem to measure many things other than steps automatically; you have to select each one when you're wanting to see it. Soooooooo all told it's solidly mediocre. It's good for counting steps, manually checking heartrate, and manually checking blood pressure (very slowly) on occasion; otherwise it's a lot weaker than most smart phones",

The connection has been great thus far; it hasn't disconnected/lost connection to my phone.<br /><br />As someone who has suffers from pulmonary lung disease, I was very excited when I found out this smart watch has the capability to track my oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. In addition, you don't have to do anything, the watch will automatically to measurements periodically throughout the day.<br /><br />It's helping me monitor and compare results over a few days. I suggest authorizing Google Fit so your hearth history is accessible when it.

        "text": "Withings wearer for almost two years here. Have had the Scanwatch for a couple months and had the Steel HR before that.<br /><br />First off, if you're reading the reviews you should definitely buy either this watch or the Steel HR. I absolutely love it. It's gorgeous, the app is great, it fits in well to daily life. Looks fantastic whether suited up or wearing grubbies to work on the car. My doctor even hooked up tri-leads to me to compare the ECG with actual medical equipment and they thought it was pretty darn close! Same with O2 sat monitor and heart rate. Quality wise, on par with its excellent forerunner, the Steel HR. The functional twisting crown with haptic feedback is a nicer touch than the push button on the old one.<br /><br />I have to ding it on one star because of the battery life and charge time compared to the prior model. My Steel HR lasted for about a month with all features enabled and charged almost completely in the time it took to take a shower. This one lasts about five days with all features enabled (I know, there are more features). But the bigger problem is charge time. I take the watch off for showers and that's a logical time to charge (obviously you want to wear this in your sleep). About 30 minutes does not come anywhere near to fully charging the battery. Just now it only went from 30-40%. So you need to find time to charge it during the day or occasionally not wear it while sleeping. I think I'm going to disable some of the continuous monitoring features which puts me back at my Steel HR just with sleep disturbance monitoring and O2 sat on demand.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you want activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, enhanced sleep monitoring, ECG and O2 sat WHILE still wearing an attractive watch, this is hard to beat. If you don't care about ECG, O2 and sleep disturbance tracking the Steel HR is the watch to get as it's more or less the same just without those features and is cheaper. As to whether the ScanWatch is with the extra money over the Steel HR, I think that depends on how much you prioritize those extra features and battery life. If this would last a week plus on a charge I'd say the extra hundred bucks is a no brainer. But battery life as it is... tougher call.<br /><br />One other note. While this watch will give you notifications, they're a bit cumbersome on the small screen. I have it turned off.",

        "text": "Update:  Watch now 10 months old and does not keep accurate time.  Initially a couple months ago, I noticed the time difference and using instructions adjusted it, thinking it must have been an odd glitch.  I am used to watches that rarely need to be adjusted and thought a Hybrid Smartwatch would be smart and never be off time.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Since writing the original glowing review, last May 2022 which was two weeks after purchase.  I have had to adjust the time several times.  The first time it was off it was 12 minutes difference.  Right now it is off 5 minutes.  A couple weeks ago it was off 4 minutes.  This is not an isolated incident.  Interestingly, the hands do not match the digital time, but all the same, both are off.  Right now the hands read exactly 4:30 while the digital is 4:31 even though the real time according to my computer and Samsung S21 phone is 4:36.  This is really a shame given the watch cost $300.  IMO, the watch is unusable if you cannot trust it for its most basic function.",

        "text": "I got Moto 360 several years ago when smart watches first came out and it was nice, but annoying.  It was tied into everything and kept giving me alerts and so eventually I got tired of it.  My wife also had a first generation Samsung Gear watch and that was about the same as the Moto.<br />Well, fast forward a few years and now my wife, daughter, son and daughter-in-law all have newer smart watches (Apple Watches and Fitbit) and they all love them.  It was time to get a new phone, so I got a Samsung  S20 FE and then decided to get the Samsung watch.  I saw on the reviews that it really works well with Samsung phones and so I decided to get the Watch 3.  I was looking at the Watch 2, which had a few less features and then I found the Watch 3 in the 41mm size and then found a refurbished one so I ended up paying about the same for the Watch 3 as I would have for the Watch 2.<br />I'm very impressed with the watch and really love it.  I didn't get the one with a cell phone, it just connects to my phone with bluetooth and/or wifi, but it's really amazing.  I get my messages, and can turn off the ones that I don't want and then I also get all the health apps.  So, now it tells me to get off my chair and walk around and does EKG and stress tesing and Oxygen levels..<br />I was concerned that the 41 mm might be too small, but it is a great size for me as you can see from the pic.  I have had a Citizen Echo Drive for more than 10 years and it is a little larger, but I like the size of the Watch 3 better.<br />If you are thinking about getting a watch, this one is a good deal right now and I believe it does work best if you use it with a Samsung phone.",

For the cost this watch does just about everything I need it to for way less money.<br /><br />A few things I love about the watch...the Battery Life. OMG the battery life! It lasted me a full week with wearing it to bed most nights, through multiple exercise walks and a few work outs, and hundreds of notifications from my messaging apps and phone calls. It's easy to clear the notifications I receive on the watch. I love that it tracks my sleep, heart rate, and stress levels easily. I also tested out in my pool for swimming and it was waterproof without having to shake the watch or turn on any special modes to keep it watertight.<br /><br />I haven't figured out of it auto detects a work out but that could be because I obviously don't work out that much.<br /><br />I tested it against my health app on my phone and they were pretty accurate against each other info steps and mileage. I can't figure out how to get the watch and the app to register my GPS coordinates to see the map of my walks but I could be missing the settings.<br /><br />The app that gives the data is easy to navigate and update any settings. Seems very similar to other track laps I've used.<br />A few things I'm not liking about this watch...<br />I feel like the band and the watch itself that comes with the watch is a little too big for my wrist. And I have a bigger wrist for a female at my size. The watch face is bigger than some of my friends apple watches and taller than my old Samsung gear fit watch. I can SEE notifications on the watch but I can't respond or give a quick response to any messages. For Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger I wouldn't expect that but for SMS messages I would like to be able to give a quick text back either by speaking a response or by selecting from some quick options.<br /><br />Those are really my only 2 complaints. I like this watch and will continue to use!",

        "text": "The blue silicone band was too small to go around my wrist. I called Skagen and they offered to sell me a bigger band. I told them I shouldn't have to pay extra for the watch to go on my wrist. They said since I bought it from Amazon there was nothing they could do. So sadly, this is getting returned.<br />I've worn plenty of watches before, and I don't have a fatty wrist. My wrist is 8 inches in circumference, which is average for a male.<br />The interesting thing about the size as I inspected and measured the watch, is that if you measure the watch laid out flat, 8 inches goes to the second to last notch, and it should fit fine. BUT -- the watch body itself obviously does not bend, which means in actual wear when the watch goes AROUND your wrist, you need an additional 3/4 to 1 inch for it to work.<br />It's basically like that one gallon jug I bought at Walmart, I got it home to make a drink mix in it just to realize that yes, it held one gallon, if you filled it to the absolute brim, at which point putting in the drink mix made it spill.<br />If your wrist is greater than 7 inches in circumference, I would not buy this watch.",

My socks have to be on the correct foot, tags on clothes need to die, I\u2019d rather wear my clothes inside out than feel a seam pressing into my skin. This band is exactly what I was looking for, barely there. It smells like real leather so I guess they weren\u2019t lying about that. The color was labeled as blue but the picture looked greenish bluish grayish. In person it looks just like their picture and I\u2019m happy about that. I\u2019m petite and overweight (5\u20194 and 175lbs) and this size is perfect, plenty of room to go bigger or smaller. I adore the thinness of the band, no more bulky Fitbit!",
