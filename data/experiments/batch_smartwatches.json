The touch screen is responsive.  The processor is fast.  Overall, the phone itself is nice.<br /><br />The app, on the other hand, is awful.  It is intuitive, but it loses Bluetooth connectivity without reason.  This is the only app that I've seen that will move forward and backward during a dial sync.  When I switch to certain dials, the progress bar will reach 61%, then count back down to 60%, then 59%, then start going back up.  It's nice to see honesty in an app, but it's just strange.<br /><br />I didn't test notifications from other apps, but no SMS text messages came through.  The setup is simple and easy with SMS notifications settings on its own section.  But once set up, no messages came through.<br /><br />Battery life?  What battery life?  After a fully charge, this watch drained to 90% in the 15 minutes I used to overlook the features and set up the app.  This from a 330mAh battery.  At this rate, the battery will be depleted in less than two hours.",

Biometric tracking seems to work reasonably well with the exception of heart rate, which seems to always read 70 no matter what I'm doing. I'm not too crazy about the aesthetic of the watch, it just looks kind of cheap to me. I got this mainly to use as a health tracking tool and to tell time, not to make and receive calls/texts with, so I haven't setup any of those features yet and may never get around to doing so. So i can't comment on ease of use for any of those features. I did like that there are quite a lot of different watch face designs that can be applied and without any additional purchase.

If your phone is on \"Do not disturb\" and you leave your phone on at night for emergency calls, the watch still vibrates with every text, regardless of whether they're on your emergency list. This is annoying when you're a light sleeper and you get a text for go cart racing or Dairy Queen at 4 am. I'm assuming it would still go off with a call as well.<br /><br />I have a Garmin Vivofit that for some reason the notification vibrations will work for a couple months, then stop working for a while, then randomly start working again. I was sick of this, and went looking for something not too expensive and found this. I'm still getting used to it, but it vibrates when I get a call or text, so I'm happy so far.

Well, I scrolled down through all the faces on the app 4 times and the shown watch face was not even there for download-What the hell!!!!! I've ordered 6 or 7 smart watches and this is the first one without magnetic charging cable. Has this plastic thingy at end of cord you have to push watch down into in order to charge. Don't like this at all. Haven't decided whether to keep or not but not off to a good start.<br />After a few days another problem.

In addition, you don't have to do anything, the watch will automatically to measurements periodically throughout the day.<br /><br />It's helping me monitor and compare results over a few days. I suggest authorizing Google Fit so your hearth history is accessible when it.

For the cost this watch does just about everything I need it to for way less money.<br /><br />A few things I love about the watch...the Battery Life. OMG the battery life! It lasted me a full week with wearing it to bed most nights, through multiple exercise walks and a few work outs, and hundreds of notifications from my messaging apps and phone calls. It's easy to clear the notifications I receive on the watch. I love that it tracks my sleep, heart rate, and stress levels easily. I also tested out in my pool for swimming and it was waterproof without having to shake the watch or turn on any special modes to keep it watertight.<br /><br />I haven't figured out of it auto detects a work out but that could be because I obviously don't work out that much.<br /><br />I tested it against my health app on my phone and they were pretty accurate against each other info steps and mileage. I can't figure out how to get the watch and the app to register my GPS coordinates to see the map of my walks but I could be missing the settings.<br /><br />The app that gives the data is easy to navigate and update any settings. Seems very similar to other track laps I've used.<br />A few things I'm not liking about this watch...<br />I feel like the band and the watch itself that comes with the watch is a little too big for my wrist. And I have a bigger wrist for a female at my size. The watch face is bigger than some of my friends apple watches and taller than my old Samsung gear fit watch. I can SEE notifications on the watch but I can't respond or give a quick response to any messages. For Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger I wouldn't expect that but for SMS messages I would like to be able to give a quick text back either by speaking a response or by selecting from some quick options.<br /><br />Those are really my only 2 complaints.

Two if you\u2019re lucky. We\u2019re never lucky. However, it\u2019s been a while and he wears it nonstop. Get this, it still works. He loves the band and all of the features.

I\u2019d fight him for it but again\u2026he body slams trees. Great purchase, guys.

Has all the bells and whistles of name brand products. While I prefer fitbit due to familiarity.<br /><br />I havent put it entirely through its paces. I noticed that it was registering nearly same heart rate as my fitbit sense. I havent it worn it long enough to determine blood oxygen. There is still a lot to learn. The learning curve feels a little clunky compared to my fitbit.<br /><br />Has ability to connect to Alexa, take and make calls, music. Can make changes through app or scroll through the screen face.<br /><br />The watch band fits my 7\" wrist and feels comfortable enough. Typical silicone band. It is attached via pins, so I imagine it is possible to swap it out but not sure. I may try some old bands to see if it is doable. I'd also prefer for it to have a soft protective cover (bumper guard) to protect screen and edges.<br /><br />I still prefer the ease of using a name brand, but this has a good looking interface. Main thing is to see how accurate it is. I think it has been fine for heart rate, steps, but will need more sleep time for seeing how well it tracks sleep and oxygen.<br /><br />I dont rate on price, but I comment. This is pretty reasonable, but it looks like there are many similar products for less. So compared to a name brand of similar features this is a bargain. Compared to other no name generics, this is competitive. Some are easily $20 less. I noticed the price on this vacillates. I think I got it for $70, and have seen it as low as 35-40.",

        "text": "This smart watch looks nice enough - someone could easily confuse it for an older Apple Watch - and its easy to make custom watch faces (I put a pic I took at an Iron Maiden show on mine). And it is jam packed with features - way more than some other watches in this price range.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have trouble trusting its more advanced features.<br /><br />A number of times when taking my temperature the watch says I have hypothermia, measuring me between 87-95f. I am a 200lb man living in in Southern California and my wife won\u2019t turn the thermostat down below 74 degrees. I don\u2019t have hypothermia. If it can\u2019t properly read my body temperature, there\u2019s no way I can trust its accuracy with many of the other health features - blood oxygen, blood pressure, heart rate, etc<br /><br />That step count seems pretty accurate but ONLY once I paired the watch with the Da Fit app. Before I paired the watch, it measure me taking like 350 steps while just sitting on my couch. Not sure why it would measure differently paired or unpaired but it did - significantly. I would not recommend this as a fitness tracker for someone without a smart phone (yes, there are still a few people without smart phones).<br /><br />And the sleep tracker seems to at least get my sleep times accurate, though I am unsure how well it reads light/deep sleep as I don\u2019t really trust the readings from it\u2019s health sensors. I want to believe its doing a good job. I like the way the app presents the sleep timeline and information. But I just don\u2019t know if its accurate because the watch thinks I have hypothermia.<br /><br />As for the non-health related functions, they are pretty spotty too. I stopped receiving text notifications after a couple days and could not get them to start back up again without completely disconnecting the phone from the app and starting over again.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks like an old gen Apple Watch.<br />- Customizable face<br />- Lots of features<br />- Doesn\u2019t technically *need* a smart phone for many features<br />- Step counter seems accurate when paired<br />- Great battery life for a smart watch. I wore it for 5 days without charging.<br />- Nice app<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Highly inaccurate step counter when it is not paired<br />- Health features are unreliable<br />- Notifications are unreliable<br />- The speaker in the watch sounds terrible<br />- Vibration function is weak and easily missable in active situations<br />- Sometimes the watch doesn\u2019t \u2018wake\u2019 from sleep as easily/instantly as it should.

        "text": "I have been wearing this for a solid 4 months, using it to track dives, swimming, running, walking, treadmill workouts, etc. In watch mode the battery lasts a long time, but for activities you will find yourself charging it after about 5-8 hours of activity use.<br /><br />I was a bit worried my skin would react as I cannot usually wear anything metal unless high quality gold or sterling silver. No problems with this watch - the band is comfortable and the watch, while a bit larger than I was used to, fits well and without any reaction.<br /><br />Functions while diving were flawless. You have a lot of parameter's you can set - this thing is designed for divers. It tracks entry and exit locations accurately. I wish I could tell it when my dive is starting and when done, the automatic feature is a bit annoying in this regard. However, it is one less thing to remember when you are in the water and doing a buddy check to get going. It is pretty neat to how nicely it updates the app on your phone and makes sharing easy.<br /><br />Pool swimming is not entirely accurate - the watch cannot record kickboard laps, for example, so if you like to vary your workout you won't have accurate times or distances. Basically, any time you are not completing actual strokes you won't get a record.<br /><br />Treadmill work - you can adjust the settings to match your treadmill readings. I found it was not very accurate and finally quit bothering to adjust it. The watch was either lower in distance or higher every time, but close enough to just let it be. At least once you leave it alone you get consistent numbers, and you can also record numbers from the treadmill if you want.<br /><br />Walking and trail running features are great - I love seeing where I was with the GPS integration. I work out regularly on a measured trail and the distances are spot-on with the MK2S. There are workouts it will suggest, but I tend to stick to my own and ignore those. I was really frustrated to find my VO2 was consistently \"Poor\" all fall, but have seen some improvement recently with regular workouts. Kind of cool getting readings like that.<br /><br />I plan to use this watch for backpacking as well - I have not had an opportunity to test it since the purchase, but my last trip my sister had a different model and it worked well other than eating power. You absolutely have to carry one or two good battery packs to charge it. I really wish this had a solar option, which I understand is in future plans, so I will more than likely upgrade when that is offered. Even so, hiking puts your wrist in the shade a lot of the time unless you are hiking alpine locations, so not sure how well solar would actually work.<br /><br />All said, I love my \"toy\". It helps keep me motivated when I see I have been in the office too long or my scores are a lot lower. I am competitive and happy to compete against myself, so it works well. I don't use the connections, although I have considered seeing if anyone I know has a Garmin, but so far its all me :D While pricy, for someone who loves a wide variety of athletic activity, you can't beat the Garmin Mk2 in any of its versions. My husband is still trying to decide if he wants the Mk2S or the Mk2i but he will be getting one or the other. Fantastic product.",

Returning this junk.<br /><br />I bought these so I'd have something other than the band that came with my Fitbit Charge 5. These are okay. They look fine, but they are really, really long, with no way to shorten them. I have small wrists (5 3/4\") and as you can tell from the photo, the end of the band comes almost to the watch face on the other side and sticks up. I did eventually pull the tab so that it lays flat, but I'm not used to having the end of the watch band on the side. The product description online says it fits a wrist 5.1\" to 8.7\". If my wrist was any smaller, the band would probably cover the watch face. Unfortunately, there wasn't a \"small\" option.",
