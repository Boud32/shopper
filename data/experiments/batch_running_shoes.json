Started seeing Xero Shoes pop up on social media and YouTube. I looked them for months and it seemed like a gimmick product. After some time I said ok I am going to try this shoe and see if they meet their hype. In July of this year I ordered the Prio Cross Trainer model. Now their instructions said adjust over a couple of weeks. Well I said hell no and put them to the test right out of the box. I wore them every chance I got for 30 days straight. I found them comfortable right out of the box and I did not experience any foot or leg discomfort during the break period. I began liking them the more I wore them. At day 31 I put my Brooks Adrenaline runners on. Within 15 mins I was aware of how unbalanced I was in that shoe and while walking around in my home said, I can\u2019t wear these any more I have to put my Xero Shoes on. I swear I referred to them specifically. I have since purchased 2 pairs of the HFS model runners and they are my favorite shoe. I wear them every day. In my old shoes at the end of the day I would change to my slides, I literally have these on until I go to bed. Closest thing to walking barefoot and still having a shoe on.",

Ok, so I am ashamed to wear them with jeans and a tee, I tried them for everyday but couldn't get over what I'll call the &#34;dad sneakers&#34; look. But I took these for a run and wow! They're very comfortable. A little clunky but flexible enough for daily training and the cushion is just right for me, sightly on the plush side but not squishy. These are my new daily runners. I don't know how long they'll last, but for the price, if I get 200 miles, I'll be happy.<br /><br />Also, if you're a 3e/4e and you like or need a wide toe box, these will deliver. I'm a smaller 4e but i need a wide toe box, especially since I'm not willing to give up my injinji toe socks. These are very spacious with plenty of room for my toe splay.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Original review: From the product pictures I wasn't sure if I'd like them or hate them. But for the price I figured I might as well try them. They fit nicely, have moderate cushion, and they're more flexible than I expected. They're basic sneakers, no bells or whistles. But they're comfortable enough I would try running in them. They're certainly not fashion forward, but I wouldn't be ashamed to wear them with jeans and a tee. And if you're looking for extra-wide these fit like a true 4e. I expected to hate them but I'm pleasantly surprised and I'll probably keep them and use they for everyday sneakers or runners.",

        "text": "I hd to send back my normal size, a 9EEE, for a size larger.  I've had this variation in size before with  New Balance so beware.  I'm still giving it 5 stars for style and price.<br /><br /> You may have noticed that price varies considerably with the color sub/style you choose.  Mine were only $21 while others are substantially more.  I assume construction is the same on all of them?  Maybe the price is based on the current inventory?  My price dropped slightly after I ordered.<br /><br />While it is sold as a running shoe (?) and is probably adequate for this purpose  a serious high mileage runner would probably pay more to get more.  If you can get the right price point as I did they are certainly worth a try as a general purpose/athletic/walking shoe.",

        "text": "First, Brooks is a top running shoe manufacturer, and I always like buying their products, and they are to be applauded for releasing shoes in widths, which lets you get a shoe that fits, which is essential.  If a shoe does not fit properly, then it will be extremely difficult to run (or walk any distance in).  The Brooks Glycerin is one model up from the Ghost, that has better cushioning, but is no longer available in a Narrow width, and is more expensive, but the Ghost is a pretty good shoe on its own.  I would have given the Ghost 5 stars, but the Ghost 14 is not quite perfect, having two areas where it could be better (and was better previously).<br /><br />The first picture shows a Ghost 14 (on the left), next to a Ghost 13 (the previous model, on the right), and you can see the Ghost 14 has less tread, so wears out sooner, I would say roughly 50-75 miles of road (asphalt) running.  The picture shows both shoes new.  The Ghost 13 also was a little more cushioned, but you can offset that some by putting a different insole in the 14, and a lot of runners replace the insoles anyway.  The thinner tread means less mileage on the 14s, but still probably as good as most of the competition, just no longer better here.<br /><br />The second pictures shows the upper collar on a Ghost 14, and the fabric Brooks is using there (not so much on the 13 and earlier models) is nice and soft, but does not hold up.  I generally see holes or failures at the top of the lace area, and on some shoes, towards the back collar area.  You get a lot of fraying, sometimes holes, which is more an appearance problem than anything that would impact running in them, but means also you cannot wear them casually, at least where someone might see the failures.  That may be an aspect that is supply chain related, they used to hold up better,  but I have seen the problem on two pair of Ghost 14s, and other manufacturers do a bit better (probably needs a bit more nylon, to hold up longer).<br /><br />I will say that the Ghost 14 has a narrower tongue at the top, that is shared with the 13 but was new there, and I have not seen it much in other shoes, but actually works very well, so I give kudos to Brooks on that design innovation.  There is less chance that during a run the tongue will shift over into the forefoot, at least in a painful way, and you don't have to stop to shift it back.<br /><br />So overall, particularly at this price point, the Brooks continues to be good value and one of the top shoes to consider, but as with anything, there are a couple of areas that could use further improvement.",

    "description": "There is no background color. The surface that you apply the sticker to will become your background color. This will be a single color sticker. This is a DIE-CUT vinyl decal meaning that the background has been trimmed off. If there is a background color in the picture, it is used only as a representation. The background color will be the surface color you place the sticker on (or clear if you put it on a window). The decal will come with clear transfer tape, so you can easily apply it to anything you like (walls, windows, cars, mailbox, mirrors, laptops, etc etc etc). I use PREMIUM Oracal brand vinyl for all decals. Application is relatively easy. Your decal will come as THREE pieces - the backing paper, the sticker itself, and the clear transfer tape. Make sure you are applying to a CLEAN surface. You carefully pull the clear transfer tape up from the backing paper, making sure that it pulls the sticker up with it (if it does not, then firmly press down on it with a squee-gee or credit card or something similar until it sticks properly to the clear transfer tape). Then you apply the sticker and clear transfer tape to whatever surface you would like the decal on. You then use a squee-gee or credit card or something similar to firmly press down once again, making sure that the sticker STICKS, and then you carefully and slowly remove the clear transfer tape from the top, leaving behind only the sticker. I have found that on some surfaces (especially walls and wood surfaces), it helps to leave the clear transfer tape on for awhile to make sure everything is sticking well before removing it. I do not issue refunds or exchanges on vinyl decals. Please understand this before you bid. Some decals are more difficult to apply than others (especially the little ones!) - likewise, some surfaces are more difficult to apply decals to.",

My personal size foot is between a 6.5-7 and I typically wear a 7 shoe for running, dress, or sandals. I can't say I know the difference between the GT-2000 model numbers (1-5?) except for new-ness.

        "text": "I bought these lights for an upcoming hike to the Grand Canyon in October. We need to start our hike before sunrise and thought these would be the perfect accessory to stop us from tripping in the dark. What I like - they are small and lightweight, with a secure clip for my shoes. The battery is a standard size. They are easy to turn off and on. I'm undecided on if these are really bright enough to be practical... is there a light - yes. Is it going to replace a flashlight - absolutely not. I don't know if I'd buy these again for the purpose of a hike, but they would be good if you are an early morning/late evening walker and runner and want additional lights for safety so cars, etc, can see you.",
