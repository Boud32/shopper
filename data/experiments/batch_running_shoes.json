        "text": "First things First.  I received this as a review item in exchange for an unbiased review. I have an 11 M foot (US) and while I wasn't overly crazy about the color, I realized they matched a lot of my race wear.  So I decided to give them a try.  The first run was a little tough but that's always the case (If you're new to running, trust me, don't run your first race without adequately breaking in your shoes). After about 15 miles I started to really like them.<br /><br />So, you see the colors.  I personally always buy the clip on laces which I did butI've probably got well over 60 miles on them now and while I'm pretty loyal to another brand (which is also costs substantially more) I will definitely be picking up another pair.<br /><br />If you are a heel striker (work on your form before you suffer the consequences of it) these have ample cusioning in the back - but take a friendly word of advice, instead of getting into bad form.  These are great shoes to improve your form with and once you have it, the extra padding in the back is not impediment.  They are very light and fit well once worn in.  I'm not trilled about the simultaneously yet cool look they have but so is life.  You don't buy running shoes to look cool unless you're a poster you buy them for performance and these deliver.<br /><br />Again I'm speaking to new runners and people that aren't that familiar with the sport. You don't want to have one pair you wear every day. They'll develop a wear pattern and it's not good. Instead buy at least two, ideally a few and alternate so that this happens at a much slower pace. From my experience, three pairs of shoes worn on alternating days will last much longer than one pair bought three times.  And this is important b/c unless you're working on bearfoot running (which seems to still be a raging philosophical battle in the podiatric communities) you'll want support, comfort and stability. As a digression, I've tried barefoot running and it fundamentally changed the way I ran, until I stepped on a piece of glass and my right foot had yet to harden.<br /><br />Again at the risk of lecturing remember that injuries are one of the biggest enemies to progress. You could easily run through broken glass on these and probably right over some smaller nails (I'm not advising it, just pointing it out).  Styling aside I love these and will be picking up another pair or two in the near future.",

I do actually use them a lot but it took nearly half a year to really break them in, and they\u2019re still fairly difficult to slip into, as the opening is not very flexible. The shoe itself is tight enough where the laces don\u2019t even really need to be there, and the toe box is fairly narrow which isn\u2019t very good for running and hiking. My pinky toe often feels wedged by this one part of the design and frequently causes pain. I really REALLY like the idea of this shoe though and it\u2019s still wearable for moderate hikes under 2 hours, I just wish they put more work and testing. It\u2019s probably better for people with thinner, narrower feet. My feet are medium wide and the top part is kind of high.",

I\u2019m so desperate to find shoes that fits my boys\u2019 wide feet that I just assumed NB would be good because I\u2019ve gotten them in the past. But no the quality is sub par. They are already falling apart and it\u2019s only been 1.5 months. I\u2019ll probably have to buy them new shoes soon which is a shame because it\u2019s not like these are some off brand cheapies. You expect more from a company like NB.",

        "text": "These New Balance shoes are great. The insoles are so comfortable and I know that my little one is getting the protection that she needs for her growing feet. The shoes fit true to size, and they width is great. She has a normal foot, I wouldn't recommend them for a child with wide feet. They are comfortable to wear and look great. This particular style is great for young children due to the velcro. Most kids by the time they get to this style shoe CAN tie their own shoes, but its so much easier and quicker for them just to  be able to do the velcro and go!We love them.",
