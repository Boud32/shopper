The colors are very pastel though, so in some lightings it's hard to differentiate between the two colors as there's not much contrast. I eventually just switched out the pastel purple caps for darker purple caps I already had. Overall they're really nice and fit my Anne Pro 2 perfectly. (Bonus: The case for storing the keys is also pretty fancy).",

I plan on putting these keycaps on a 75% keyboard that won't arrive for another couple of months so in the pictures, I only put it on part of my keyboard to test them out. I want to \"preserve\" that new keycap feeling later. :)<br /><br />These keycaps are fairly thick and have the standard PBT texture. The doubleshot legends are quite clear and none of the spacebars are warped! This is a new profile I've never typed on and I can't find much information on the web about it so I included a lot of pictures. I compared them in the pictures to my Ducky keyboard with doubleshot ABS. They actually aren't too different from OEM keycap profile (from the Ducky) height but some of the rows are higher. They're much more shapely and the F and J keys have a deeper dish. Compared to DSA keycaps, they don't seem to be quite as deep dishey overall which I actually prefer.<br />The keycaps fit snug on cherry mx brown stems, more so than my Ducky keycaps. They aren't hard to put on though. Some of the stems have a small part of plastic missing from the MX cross area but it's only a handful of the keycaps and it didn't effect the fit. I've included photos of this as well.<br />Overall they're great keycaps that I won't be using yet until my keyboard for them arrives.",

The only problem I found was that the USB-C male input was a tad long for my ANNE PRO Clone, a Dierya x Kemove DK61 60% Keyboard. It might be my keyboard's own build quality, or that maybe these cables are meant for more rugged custom boards. If I move my keyboard drastically it might disconnect, but luckily that rarely happens. I'm more than satisfied with the cable, more like enamored. I'd buy again for a future custom keyboard build for sure.",

So it was essentially wired, while I prefer the wireless aesthetic.<br /><br />This one avoids the backlight killing the battery life as well as internal battery degradation.

No cord to deal with.<br /><br />Seems well built, heavy, and doesn\u2019t slide on the desk. Nice price point. Easy to set up.

I liked the older acrylic Apple keyboard and I own a mechanical keyboard with click-switches (blue), but this one makes touch typing so much more comfortable.<br />I wasn\u2019t sure if I would like the tactile keys without click, because I actually like the click. They are just very loud. Logitech\u2019s K845 (with Cherry MX red) is a great keyboard as well, but louder and has a cable.<br />I wish this keyboard would be backlit though. Black keyboards in front of big screens need some sort of illumination. I got one of these USB LED lights that I plugged behind my monitor, that half-solves the problem by providing some backlight.<br />Still it\u2019s awesome to write on it. It\u2019s focus is to be a mechanical keyboard. So much that it seems that it skipped the product design. It looks like an OEM-Keyboard from 1995. That\u2019s in a way uncompromisingly functional, but next to a modern flat butterfly keyboard it looks like someone parked an old Volvo next to a Miata.<br />The quality is good. The keycaps are heavy and lettering sharp. It might be confusing for some that the \u2018upper\u2019 characters are printed next to the main set in the same size.<br />Battery life seems not to be a problem. I am pretty much writing all day, and I\u2019m still on the first set of batteries that came in the package.<br />PROS AND CONS<br />+ Precise keyboard for touch-typing<br />+ Quiet enough for shared work areas<br />+ Height adjustable<br />+ Great quality<br />+ Long Battery life<br />+ Connects via dongle, not Bluetooth (yes, for me that\u2019s a pro. Bluetooth sucks)<br />+ Compact with no number pad<br /><br />- Chunky design<br />- No backlight<br />- Very heavy<br />- Vague keycap lettering<br />- No number pad (*conflict*)<br />I can recommend this keyboard to anyone who is typing over a long amount of times. It takes a while to get used to, but once adjusted it\u2019s less tiring than modern butterfly or rubber cap keyboards, because the keys don\u2019t bottom out that easily, and feel better to the fingertips.

I am very happy with these.<br /><br />The only thing I am a bit disappointed about is that the special (non-standard) Capslock key does not fit my keyboard; the slot where you are supposed to insert the switch is not centered correctly.

The print on the keys is very classic, large, and easy to read. This keycap set contains both peach and sea green keycaps for the function keys, space bar, escape, and enter keys. You can mix and match them until your hearts delight. You even get some extra keys for media keys if your keyboard has them, plus menu and function keys. You get a wide variety of keys that will fit most Cherry MX style keyboards easily. The plastic is nice and textured so your fingers won't slip off the keycaps when you are typing on the keyboard. I would highly recommend these keycaps as an upgrade to ABS keycaps, and for customizing your keyboard in a cute vintage style.",

        "text": "The keyboard is very visually appealing. I do not know if my lack of keyboard knowledge is why I give this 4/5 stars, but there are a few features I do not like. Starting with the positives, the backlight (light blue not changeable) is very appealing and not hard on the eyes, the swappable red switches are nice because I like red, and the linear red switches mean it has a nice click noise when typing. Moving into the cons, there is a bit that is annoying. The most notable, and would probably lower the rating more if I wasn't nice, is the spring noises from the keys. There is a buzzing noise that is left if a key is tapped too hard. This can be fixed by buying lube, but annoying nonetheless. Another feature is the lack of hotkey commands. I write a bit of papers and I usually have multiple tabs open. Trying to hotkey a tab to the left or right side of my screen doesn't work because to use arrow keys, the fn key needs to be held and that doesn't work for the windows hotkey: win+arrow_key. Another annoying hotkey feature is the 'del' key which is fn+n. The n key is in a bit of a bad spot to use the 'delete'' function. Of course, these can all be changed by editing the layers of the keyboard, but it is a long and annoying process that I have not taken the time to do yet. The last issue is the key colors. At night, seeing the gray keys, with the backlight on, is a bit difficult. The second photo attached also has extra keys added, not all of them can be attached to the keyboard because there isn't a spot for it (a bit weird but ok).<br /><br />Pros:<br />nice backlight (not changeable color)<br />clacking linear red switches<br />extra switch colors<br /><br />Cons:<br />Spring noise<br />keyboard's default button layer<br />hard to see switches at night",

        "text": "Pros:<br />- Beautifully and conveniently packaged and organized. Caps come on three trays with plastic film on them so that nothing will have shifted in transit. It's very easy to replace your caps and keep your old set save and organized in the trays, too. Simple to find any specialized keys that you may need in the trays.<br />- Print is easy to see and seems durable/high contrast. No funky fonts that are hard to read.<br />- Looks awesome with RGB.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- There are no tactile nubs on the F and J keys to indicate homerow. As a touch typist, this was almost a dealbreaker.<br />- Color is way off from the images in the description. The images in the description show a clear white color to the keycaps. Along with the \"clear/translucent\" descriptors, I believed I was going to get more of a white/iced translucent look. Nope. The caps are basically colorless clear. They are smooth and glossy with no texture. I left some of the OG white keys on my keyboard to show the color clearly side by side. Not the look I was expecting from the images and description.<br /><br />Good to know:<br /><br />- I've never used ASA profile before, and generally prefer XDA, so these are a little taller than I'm used to on XDA, but more rounded (and, I think, more comfortable, than OEM. I had some lousy stock OEM caps on my old keyboard, and I do feel these caps are an improvement. They are sufficiently dense, and give me a slightly deeper, more muted sound from my keypresses with my brown switches, which I like, compared to the more plasticky/hollow caps that were original to my board.<br />- Despite having a glossy finish, I don't find these keys to be slippery--the slight curvature leads your fingertips toward the center of the keys easily and they're comfortable to use.<br />- I really hate that there are no homerow nubs. Who skips that? Come on.",

        "text": "I have the \u201cWhite\u201d color option in this set of keycaps from Akko. White is a bit misleading, the color is actually glossy and nearly translucent. This is actually what I wanted, I was looking all over for nearly clear keycaps, but I did want to point that out.<br /><br />If you like maximum backlighting, this might be the set for you. I was using white pudding caps before, and I thought they let a lot of light shine through. The difference is night and day. These Akko caps show backlighting on all sides and the top of the cap. I\u2019ve included a picture of a white pudding cap surrounded by the clear Akkos to show the difference.<br /><br />I\u2019m using the keycaps with Akko Vintage White (MX) switches. The keycaps fit well, but they took a bit of force to fit on the switches.<br /><br />I am disappointed the F and J keys do not have ridges or bumps. I\u2019m a touch typist and using an ergo board with 56 keys, I rely on those ridges to help me orient my hands. This set has so much variety that I wish Akko had included doubles of F and J or even blanks with the ridges.<br /><br />Speaking of keycap variety: the set has some great 1u options! My current keyboard is an Iris Rev 6, all keys are 1u size. But most keycap sets don\u2019t have 1u keycaps for Shift, Control, Command/Windows, and so on. This set does, which is a big help. I also like the cute animal keycaps, they add some fun to my board.<br /><br />I believe the ASA height is original to Akko. They have a helpful height chart on their site, comparing ASA to OEM, JDA, OSA, and Cherry. I was using OEM before, and switching to ASA and the glossy feel of the keycaps took about two days of adjustment.",

I chose the grey so whatever keyboard I hook up (or any USB-c peripheral) it looks nice.<br /><br />Only ding I would give it is that if the keyboard needs to be to the left the cable off the coils is on top and does not look as nice.  If the cable is oriented to the right, it looks better.  I don't have any major issues here, but it is something that shoudl be in the product description maybe.<br /><br />Overall, really nice and glad I bought it!",
