It's like they took a bunch of flawed pieces and sold them to us as a set. Like another user said, I expected the shift, caps lock and tab keys to have the words spelled out and not just arrows.<br /><br />There are rough bumps and weirdly broken pieces of plastic at the top of every keycap, as you can see on my picture. It is very hard to read the keys with backlight on since the font is so thin. The keyboard photographs well but it's very hard to see what key you are pressing. I feel deceived by the company and wish I had bought the HyperX ones instead, even though I didn't like the font.",

At first, it drove me crazy but now I notice that the green light signals when this is happening and goes solid when ready which alleviates the \"let's go\" anxiety because I know what's happening. I love that it pairs to 3 devices. 2 via Bluetooth and one via usb.<br /><br />Another weird thing is maybe at least 1 time a week I have to unplug and plug the keyboard back in when I cannot type on my device and I know that the correct device is selected and the solid green light is on. If there were a better typewriter-style keyboard in all black and chrome with 10-key and pairs to at least 3 devices that don't have the buffering when swapping device or intermittent typing issue,  I would have picked it but it doesn't exist.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Key caps are already falling apart after 3 months use!

Second gen chipsets have \u201cPassthrough Mode\u201d to send special characters such as multimedia keys (play, pause, volume up/down), which improves keyboard compatibility. Keyboard software such as Logitech Options, Corsair iCUE, etc conflicts with the emulation and limits the ability to use macro keys. We recommend using the KVM\u2019s USB2.0 port as a workaround if this software if needed. USB2.0 port does not have emulation programming and KVM will not recognize hotkey commands.

I liked the older acrylic Apple keyboard and I own a mechanical keyboard with click-switches (blue), but this one makes touch typing so much more comfortable.<br />I wasn\u2019t sure if I would like the tactile keys without click, because I actually like the click. They are just very loud. Logitech\u2019s K845 (with Cherry MX red) is a great keyboard as well, but louder and has a cable.<br />I wish this keyboard would be backlit though. Black keyboards in front of big screens need some sort of illumination. I got one of these USB LED lights that I plugged behind my monitor, that half-solves the problem by providing some backlight.<br />Still it\u2019s awesome to write on it. It\u2019s focus is to be a mechanical keyboard. So much that it seems that it skipped the product design. It looks like an OEM-Keyboard from 1995. That\u2019s in a way uncompromisingly functional, but next to a modern flat butterfly keyboard it looks like someone parked an old Volvo next to a Miata.<br />The quality is good. The keycaps are heavy and lettering sharp. It might be confusing for some that the \u2018upper\u2019 characters are printed next to the main set in the same size.<br />Battery life seems not to be a problem. I am pretty much writing all day, and I\u2019m still on the first set of batteries that came in the package.<br />PROS AND CONS<br />+ Precise keyboard for touch-typing<br />+ Quiet enough for shared work areas<br />+ Height adjustable<br />+ Great quality<br />+ Long Battery life<br />+ Connects via dongle, not Bluetooth (yes, for me that\u2019s a pro. Bluetooth sucks)<br />+ Compact with no number pad<br /><br />- Chunky design<br />- No backlight<br />- Very heavy<br />- Vague keycap lettering<br />- No number pad (*conflict*)<br />I can recommend this keyboard to anyone who is typing over a long amount of times. It takes a while to get used to, but once adjusted it\u2019s less tiring than modern butterfly or rubber cap keyboards, because the keys don\u2019t bottom out that easily, and feel better to the fingertips.

The doubleshot legends are quite clear and none of the spacebars are warped! This is a new profile I've never typed on and I can't find much information on the web about it so I included a lot of pictures. I compared them in the pictures to my Ducky keyboard with doubleshot ABS. They actually aren't too different from OEM keycap profile (from the Ducky) height but some of the rows are higher. They're much more shapely and the F and J keys have a deeper dish. Compared to DSA keycaps, they don't seem to be quite as deep dishey overall which I actually prefer.<br />The keycaps fit snug on cherry mx brown stems, more so than my Ducky keycaps. They aren't hard to put on though. Some of the stems have a small part of plastic missing from the MX cross area but it's only a handful of the keycaps and it didn't effect the fit.

        "text": "The keyboard is very visually appealing. I do not know if my lack of keyboard knowledge is why I give this 4/5 stars, but there are a few features I do not like. Starting with the positives, the backlight (light blue not changeable) is very appealing and not hard on the eyes, the swappable red switches are nice because I like red, and the linear red switches mean it has a nice click noise when typing. Moving into the cons, there is a bit that is annoying. The most notable, and would probably lower the rating more if I wasn't nice, is the spring noises from the keys. There is a buzzing noise that is left if a key is tapped too hard. This can be fixed by buying lube, but annoying nonetheless. Another feature is the lack of hotkey commands. I write a bit of papers and I usually have multiple tabs open. Trying to hotkey a tab to the left or right side of my screen doesn't work because to use arrow keys, the fn key needs to be held and that doesn't work for the windows hotkey: win+arrow_key. Another annoying hotkey feature is the 'del' key which is fn+n. The n key is in a bit of a bad spot to use the 'delete'' function. Of course, these can all be changed by editing the layers of the keyboard, but it is a long and annoying process that I have not taken the time to do yet. The last issue is the key colors. At night, seeing the gray keys, with the backlight on, is a bit difficult. The second photo attached also has extra keys added, not all of them can be attached to the keyboard because there isn't a spot for it (a bit weird but ok).<br /><br />Pros:<br />nice backlight (not changeable color)<br />clacking linear red switches<br />extra switch colors<br /><br />Cons:<br />Spring noise<br />keyboard's default button layer<br />hard to see switches at night",

Well, you get an extra set of keys! Not every key but, nothing to sneeze at!<br /><br />It feels good and been holding up well! Other than a squeaky space bar. No issues.

The packaging was nicely made, and does not feel cheap in any way, this company really put a lot of love into the product.<br /><br />My only complaint is that with the direction of the coil, I can not have the Asceny logo facing up with a left side charge port on my keyboard, otherwise the cable does not sit correctly on the desk.

They look so nice and very very close and clean to the originals.<br /><br />the only way you can tell that they are not GMK is by looking at the bottom. The dye-sub is a little weak in the finish but you never look under the hood.<br /><br />If you like the greenery landscape or the color great fanatic this is the best set. It's super clean, subtle, and sounds great! I have this set on my KBD67 Lite and it sounds so much better than my ABS keycaps i paid $80 for. The texture is also very nice and I seem to be keen on this rough like texture than the ABS smoother feel. It kind of is matte if that makes sense.  The legends on all the alphas are uniform, no thickness issues.  The ,.? and other modifiers might have a thinner font but negligible.<br /><br />I can't say enough what a great first impression these sets have given me and if they produce an \"Oblivian\" replica i'm jumping on it as well.

After a quick search, I was glad to find this combo as it covers the escape key AND the tab key in a matching set. I tried both keycaps on multiple boards and I am thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />I can easily say that this keycap set will fit both regular MX stems and box stems, as they fit on my box inks and NK creams without issue. I swapped them on 6 different boards just to see how they looked with different sets and did not find there to be any loosening.<br /><br />Being able to change the \"screen\" is a fun touch but I am leaving it on the apple logo for nostalgia. The keyboard on the tab key is magnetic and I have found myself playing with it while working today.<br /><br />Overall this is an easy 10/10 for both price and quality. I highly recommend it for both enthusiasts who want a fun budget set but also for anyone with a keyboard in general!",

This set (YMDK 96 84 ANSI ISO Key) went on just fine, and are a great frugal find.<br /><br />I bought these for an relatively inexpensive TKL mechanical wireless keyboard (RK87G) because the OEM keycaps were set in a truly fugly and illegible typeface.<br /><br />These YMDKs feel good, and have a slightly deeper \"thunk\" when they bottom out. The two-character keys are typeset vertically, as Underwood and Remington intended. Although the font size on most of the keys is a big, they are fine and give the keyboard a bit of a homemade retro look.<br /><br />NOTE Specific to the RK87G: This YMDK set does not have a ScrlLk key.  The right Shift and right CTRL on this set are a little too small, so I just left the old ones on. I also left the OEM ScrlLk, Page Up, and arrow keys on because they have symbols for controlling the RGB LEDs. If you use the RKs function keys for app and control shortcuts, you may want to leave those on as well.<br /><br />May 30, 2021<br />I've had these for a little over six months now. Still a great value set the money. I installed them on a keyboard I use for hours on end nearly every day. The printing on the beige keys hasn't faded, but I've noticed that the grey keys with white printing are beginning to fade.

We took all the best parts of the NIBBLE and added some of the most popular requests: true split shift/space/backspace. The SNAP is configurable, programmable, and easily assembled. 100% through hole design The SNAP uses a Pro Micro MCU instead of a discrete micro-controller chip. It offers the fun and aesthetic of a kit without having to worry about soldering the difficult bits like USB connectors. All required parts diodes, caps, and ICs) are through-hole, meaning they're easy and forgiving to solder. underglow LEDs are surface-mount Multiple Layout Options Use the SNAP in split mode, or snap it whoa, get it?) together for a more traditional layout. Strong internal magnets hold the two sides together and magical spring-loaded pogo pin contacts mean there's no need for a TRRS cable when the two sides are attached. The SNAP supports many configurations and layouts: Split space/backspace, split shift, ISO enter, and more. Since it runs QMK firmware and uses VIA, it's easy to change keymaps, program macros, and customize functionality. RGB underglow ready 10x optional bottom-mounted SMT LEDs shine nicely through the acrylic support material. Included Top & bottom PCB Acrylic supports M2 standoffs & screws Diodes, ICs, decoupling caps, reset switch RGB underglow, speaker, magnets, and pogo pins Rotary encoder & color-matched knob TRRS cable and mini bumpons Not included 2x Bit-Cs or Pro Micro Compatible MCU MX-compatible switches & keycaps PCB-mount stabilizers NOTE: This is a kit which requires assembly and soldering!

I don't know of other split 75% keyboards with pro micro support that also have great documentation, support and community. If you are willing to put in the time you will be rewarded with a unique keyboard, and the kit really is fun to put together for experienced builders.<br /><br />I would knock down half star as I encountered some issues with the fitting of the acrylic plate, specifically in these areas:<br />1. acrylic plate fitting at the keyboard split edge, had to use an exacto knife<br />2. acrylic plate fitting with bottom screws of the PCB mount stabilizers, had to make the holes wider<br />3. snap magnets did not fit, gave up trying to fit these<br />4. components pin through the solder joints interfered with acrylic, this is expected and is easily fixable by trimming them down.<br /><br />Apart from that everything worked as expected. Firmware worked on first try and I was easily able to get it working with VIA.",

        "text": "Very heavy keyboard. Certainly doesn't feel like a mechanical keyboard. The tiny insert offers ZERO CLUES as to how the keyboard is supposed to function, ie there is no documentation. The web site reads more like an ad, no clues there, either. The flashing color LEDs remind me of a 1980s video arcade game. You can reduce the brightness down to zero but that's about it. There's a really ugly and difficult to read quasi-sci-fi typeface used on the key caps. The keyboard itself is quite nice, quite heavy. Little kickstand-type feet if you want it angled. A small plastic ramp is included if  you want to rest  your left hand. What's missing here is a MANUAL of some kind. Even a PDF would be just great. Otherwise it's a mystery how this keyboard is supposed to work, what the features are. Somebody blew it. It's nicely designed with some interesting features, but unless you enjoy hardware sleuthing, how are you supposed to know what works, and how it works? Rather maddening. So I don't see this being used, I'll go back to my older keyboard which actually has mechanical clickity click key responses. It's baffling that with  the attention to detail paid to this keyboard that they wouldn't include or provide some DOCUMENTATION. It's basic.",

        "text": "Oh wow!  I have waited for several days to review this because my computer was broken and I had to wait for a service tech to drive down and DO something, ANYTHING, with it. When the box came, I was asking myself what it was because the box was HUGE, The inner box was still pretty big, but not huge, It provides a lot of information--including that the keyboard is waterproof, nice since I'm a klutz--and something I'd either not noticed or had forgotten. In side that was a plain black box with a Bloody  hand--or is it a hand print?  The lights are cool, and the bloody hand lights up on both the keyboard and the Bloody Mouse I got a couple of days before the keyboard arrived.  The fast key response is amazing. Even though I'm not a &quot;gamer,&quot; I'm not a total computer novice, having gotten my first one with a gig on the hard drive--custom built--and my co-workers said I'd never use all that memory. Right. Now, my phone has 64 times that with room for expansion and does more than that first computer--or the second--and maybe more than the fifth or sixth.  I still have to download the software, which will probably wait until tomorrow, but I could not wait to start playing with this. It will take me a little bit to get used to the clicking keys, but I am finding I don't mind it, after just writing this much and, well, it does bring back memories. Also, they help me notice if I don't hit a key quite hard enough. (My high school graduation present was a used Royal portable typewriter in a horrible shade of blue--and I still dislike blue. But, I think I can get past those memories. My parents weren't cheap. They were broke at that point in time.) And now, I have probably spent more on this keyboard, even though I was amazingly fortunate to be able to get this at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, than my family spent on that typewriter.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect of this, but read what one of the other reviewers said about not needing to be a gamer to appreciate this and I can see, already, how true it is. My typing is faster and I'm just using this for the first time. And now with this and the matching mouse, I can dare to try some of the things I hear about. No, even with this pair, I won't have the fast response time of someone a few decades (well, quite a few) younger, but it will sure help even the playing field for me.  I am so eager to put this through its paces and I am SO happy with it, even this soon, that I have no problem recommending anything with the Bloody name on it.  And I did live in New Zealand for a while, so know that Bloody is not quite considered a polite word.  Too Bloody bad. I love the keyboard and mouse!<br /><br />Addendum: Two days along and I'm even happier! Wow! This thing is great!",

        "text": "Nice keys that feel similar to mechanical.  Spacebar is set up so you can press it on the edges and it will  respond just as well as hitting the middle.  Larger keys such as Backspace, Return, Ctrl, and the Windows all work fine.<br /><br />QWER and ASDF keys are colored orange and have a unique, bumpy texture you don't feel on the smooth black keys. I would have preferred orange keys on ASDF and JKL; since that is \"Home Row\" for typists.  The bumpy texture would make it easier to find Home Row without looking.<br /><br />Arrow keys are the common one on top and three below configuration.  The keys I don't often see are a FN key and a weird key with no text label  instead of a second Windows key on the right of the spacebar. The \"weird\" key seems to work as if you right-clicked the mouse. Finally,  you will see the Print Screen (PS), Scroll Lock (SL), and Page/Break (PB) keys placed above the numeric keypad.<br /><br />Aside from the extra keys, the slightly increased resistance, lit keys, and the increased weight of the keyboard itself, there isn't much else that separates this from a standard keyboard.  All keys stay lit when you type and switch to rotating patterns after a minute or two of inactivity. Hit any key and you are back to fully lit.",

        "text": "There is a lot to like about the Bloody Gaming LED B720 Light Strike Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. Fit and feel, construction, lighting scheme, and most importantly \u201cmechanical keys\u201d are all first rate.<br /><br />Right out of the box, you can feel the weight of this keyboard.  No lightweight here.  Plugging it in, there are no issues with Windows 7 to 10 \u2013 drivers are automatically detected and the keyboard is immediately available. The keys light up with a rainbow of color, with each row presenting a different color. On this B720 model, there is no way to change the color scheme, but most people will find it pleasant.  In idle mode, it presents a couple of animations, upon which any key touch will immediately bring back full lighting. Lighting is dimmable to totally \u201coff\u201d.<br /><br />Of course, you do not purchase a keyboard like this without awareness that a variety of mechanical key types exist.  My other keyboard is a Tt esport MEKA Cherry Brown with Cherry MX Brown switches.  Cherry MX brown switches have a moderate travel distance, with some tactile feedback for keystroke and a definite bottom and light clicking noise.  For me, Brown switches provide a nice blend for gaming and touch typing. The Bloody B720 has an Infrared Optic Switch exclusively developed by Bloody, and indicated to be closest to a Cherry MX Black switch. For me, comparing the Optic Switch to Cherry Brown switches, the throw distance seems shorter for the Bloody keys, with less resistance and the bottom just slightly softer.  Click wise, it is mechanically positive, but noise wise less than the brown switch.  Personally, I find both very desirable for the way I type and game, and struggle with finding a preference between \u201cOptic black\u201d and Cherry Brown.<br /><br />On other aspects of the keyboard, the Bloody B720 comes with textured and differently colored gaming silicone keys, along with a nice little left hand support for same.  The quick guide provides limited documentation and the Bloody website for software download. While I did not spend a lot of time with the software, it allows macros and some customization\u2014although no changes to lighting for the B720.<br /><br />If there is anything someone might not like about the Bloody B720 it would probably be the font selection for the keys (a bit sci-fi) along with an inability to control the lighting a bit more fully.  For me, it is fine, I like the way it behaves during use and in its more animated modes.<br /><br />Bloody Gaming may or may not be right about their own proprietary keys becoming popular, since gamers have definite preferences and a multitude of experiences with a variety of keyboards.  I can say, that for the type of work and play I do on a daily basis, I would recommend this keyboard to anyone thinking about a mechanical keyboard.  The Bloody B720 is an attractive solid keyboard providing a great mechanical key typing and gaming experience.",

During a recent move I left my previously mentioned perfectly fine working keyboard outside for an extended period of time, uncovered in the rain and sun and any other elements that rolled though Southern California for those few months. When I finally returned to the keyboard, I found that it had become yet another casualty of the pandemic. Finally I had good cause for a new keyboard, and my research led me to try this one. And like the famous tattoo says, I have no ragrets!<br /><br />I plugged it in and immediately it lit up and off my little fingies went, zipping around the keyboard with the grace and elegance of a gold medal winning gymnast at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Every click and clack was like music to my ears, each sentence I typed sounding like a symphony composed by Mozart himself! I now look forward to typing my weekly emails to mother, catching her up with her favorite son\u2019s (sorry Richard, but you know it\u2019s true!) comings and goings!<br />I\u2019ve only had this keyboard for about a week, so time will tell if it will hold up to the rigorous poundings that accompany each email I compose, but as of now I would not hesitate to recommend this keyboard to all my many (ok, zero) friends!

        "text": "Do you need a cable with an aviator connection?  No, but do you want one? Yes!  I like the mesh sleave on the cable, that gives a premium look and a perceived ruggedness.  I chose the grey so whatever keyboard I hook up (or any USB-c peripheral) it looks nice.<br /><br />Only ding I would give it is that if the keyboard needs to be to the left the cable off the coils is on top and does not look as nice.  If the cable is oriented to the right, it looks better.  I don't have any major issues here, but it is something that shoudl be in the product description maybe.<br /><br />Overall, really nice and glad I bought it!",
