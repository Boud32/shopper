    "description": "Product Description\nGetting your kids excited about their daily tooth brushing routine requires more than just an ordinary kids toothbrush. Give them the fun and functional GUM Crayola Twistables Toothbrush for kids. It\u2019s one of the best toothbrushes to keep kids engaged with bright and colorful handles, as well as a twistable head that can be extended from the toothbrush handle with a twist of the bottom green knob. When not in use, kids can twist the toothbrush back and store upside down in the included toothbrush cap. The cap doubles as a stand to keep the brush from rolling off the bathroom sink. This toothbrush also comes with soft, antibacterial bristles to further inhibit germ growth. The toothpaste sweet spot is highlighted by the colored bristles in the center of the compact head to teach children how much toothpaste they should be using. If you want to equip your little ones with a kids' toothbrush that will get them enthusiastic about their twice-daily tooth brushing routine, the GUM Crayola Twistable Toothbrush is what you need.\nManufacturer Contact Information\n1-888-777-3116",

        "text": "Its just a cheap what you would get for free at the kids dentist office kind of brush. Its totally flat but thats not a huge deal for me. The brush twisting gets my kids more into brushing their teeth but when I am brushing, the brush itself doesn't lock into place as as you are going around in their mouth and moving your hand it twists and doesn't stay in place. So I am typically adjusting at least once mid brush. Usually my kiddos are good about brushing but they have their days so its those days its really an issue for me. For the price it isn't worth it for me.",

These work as awesome teethers for my twins but in order to make it work for toothbrushing independence, you do need a cooperative toddler who's willing to bite down and keep the teeth between the brushes. If your kids are willing to bite down and brush with these, they work great for encouraging toddlers to maintain healthy dental hygiene. I think it's already awesome for the price and works great as a teether.",
