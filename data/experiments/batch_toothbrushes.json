I was drawn to this because it is fluoride free. The toothpaste is nice and minty fresh, my mouth felt clean and fresh afterwards. I know that the brownish colored toothpaste may bother some people but I have used herbal toothpaste before so no color is \"weird\" or off limits for me - as long as they taste fine. There's even a few brands out there that has black colored paste! I really like the mouthwash as well and I'm surprised it is alcohol free because I feel like it does as good of a job as an alcohol one that I just recently purchased - minus the burn. My mouth just smelled and felt amazing after using both. I wasn't as fond of the dental gel as I found it useless and not something I would want to use much of.

I also really like that they are super soft bristles and are pretty gentle on that gum line, however, the brush head is huge and takes a little getting used to.  I have a big mouth and kind of wonder how this would work on a child or petit adult.
