Anyone else have this problem?! Anyway... this Seenda connects directly with Bluetooth, and connects instantly. If it sleeps (after a few hours?) it wakes and re-connects with one click, in less than a second. I charged the battery when I bought it a few weeks ago, and forgot that I might need to charge it again one day. Still going. Downsides: it is much smaller and lighter than I am used to (the M310 is easily twice as thick/tall) so I am getting used to that.

It starts out with the mouse going to sleep all on it's own, and then it gets worst (you wouldn't think it possible, would you). I left the laptop and mouse on while I ran to the store, when I came back it was working VERY intermittent (very jerky) so I opened it thinking maybe my batteries weren't all that good.<br /><br />What did I find? One of the batteries was so hot I couldn't touch it. I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire.<br /><br />I should have known better than to buy some Chinese garbage. Into the trash it went.<br /><br />Don't buy this, it's a waste of good money.",

        "text": "Before this I have never really considered changing the mouse feet.  The only reason I purchased these was because I need to remove the old ones to solder in a new switch.<br /><br />With the new micro switches installed. https://amzn.to/3ElgafC ( incase you are curious which ones) and the new feet this made a whole new mouse.<br /><br />The feet arrived perfect no bends or wrinkles.  Super easy to install.  Just make sure you clean the area really good with some alcohol.<br /><br />They glide so much better than stock feet.  The feel is simply amazing.  Now whenever I purchase a new mouse I will be upgrading the feet.  If you are on the fence about it I would say go for it.<br /><br />For durability I have had these on for over a month and they have no signs of wear.  They still perform excellent.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope that it was helpful in your purchase decision",

Its like someone took a solid sheet of plastic and cut a line down the middle to allow you to press down on the left or right side, its terrible.  Scroll wheel feels fine.  DPI button just cycles through, no way to go up or down, just cycles through 3 modes.  Very uncomfortable.  For the price, you get two and both are exactly like this so I doubt its defective.  I only got these to control my streaming PC so its not a HUGE deal, but if youre getting these for daily use - DONT DO IT.  I can hardly put up with these and I use them for maybe 10 mins a day.  Pay 15$ for one mouse.  I honestly feel like I could crush these with my hand - thats how crappy they feel.  They also go to sleep mode after like 5 mins so I have to constantly click it to wake it up, and it ends up opening apps.  Not worth the 15$",

        "text": "Great quality, precision cut pieces that fit EXACTLY in the shape of the mouse. Whoever designed the CAD for this did a great job on the measurements. Using the grip itself, also crazy how something so small makes a big difference. No more worrying about it slipping off my right thumb which I mentally couldn't handle. It's shame that Logitech didn't design the grip but this will do nicely until they do.",

        "text": "I'm only using the side grips. (No issue with the texture of the buttons, so imo, its best to just not use them and keep the mouse as light as possible)<br /><br />Its definitely an improvement over the stock plastic feel, which is too smooth for me. These add some grip, and even a bit of cushion.<br /><br />Guess I was expecting a more grippy feeling. Maybe a more pronounced texture.  There is definitely room for improvement for those of us with sweaty gaming hands.<br /><br />I also wish the edges were tapered off at its edges rather than a hard cut, but that's a minor nitpick and not too important.<br /><br />I will say with these grips, I am having trouble deciding between which mouse to use primarily... G Pro Wireless or Viper Ultimate. This is definitely something that was missing from the G Pro Wireless's design for me.",

The picture in the display makes it look like the mouse has a little bit of sparkle and a fuchsia lip stamp on it. It\u2019s the cheapest crap I have ever seen. The picture on the mouse looks like it was blown up way to large to fit on the mouse. It feels like cheap plastic and for $20 I really could have bought something much nicer. I am not happy with this at all. It\u2019s not worth one star. Update!!! The clickers are backwards so now when I go to select something it opens up the small menu the way it would if you right click. This is completely trash. So disappointing.",
