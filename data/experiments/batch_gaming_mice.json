The packaging I got the mouse and was really nice, really simple, but easy to open. The mouse was easy to set up, and the RGB looks pretty cool. There is a really cool DPI changer function that makes gaming much easier, however, I can't recommend this mouse for gaming because the ergonomics are pretty trash. I have to cramp my hand like a claw over the top of the mouse and after long periods of use it does start hurting. The surface is also pretty slippery, so I found that my hand slips on the mouse all the time. The tracking however, is great! And I would have to say that biggest plus is the battery life. I got this about 2 weeks ago, charged it once, and it is yet to die! I think the features of this mouse are great, but I would not recommend it. Purely because of the ergonomics, if you are going to use this mouse often, then you probably should go if something more ergonomic.",

Like before, the Drakonia Black has eleven buttons and a 4-way scroll wheel, with each being freely programmable through the included configuration software to perform various different functions. An ADNS-9800 laser sensor from Avago operates under the gray dragon scales casing, with the current DPI setting in use indicated by a constantly illuminating LED. The SoftSkin surface of the Drakonia Black offers a soft grip and prevents perspiration build-up, ensuring the mouse fits perfectly in the hand even during heated battles. Likewise, the ergonomic shape of the Drakonia Black is designed for stability and control: its outwardly curved underside offers more grip during very small and precise movements as well as a high-level of comfort during long gaming sessions. Therefore the Drakonia Black is aimed especially at FPS Snipers and RTS/RPG gamers - the type of players who typically launch themselves into long battles and epic adventures. In the underside of the Drakonia Black you will find six metal weights comprising the Weight Tuning System, allowing the fighting weight of the mouse to be adjusted at any time.

        "text": "UPDATE: Two months! Two months this mouse lasted, and that was with very light use. Fully charged, I was just scrolling with it when I felt the wheel break. It just stopped making the little clicky sound/feeling. No trauma, no misuse, just very very very cheaply made. I surrender. It's time to cough up the money and buy the Apple brand mouse for my MacBook. My sanity is at least worth the $60.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />After three previous tries, I finally got a Bluetooth mouse for my MacBook. I'm hoping this one is sturdier than the last I purchased that barely lasted six months. That remains to be seen, but given the product materials, I'm not hopeful. Making the connection after power-up or sleep mode is a little finicky. Also, a solid flat dark surface/mouse pad seems to be a prerequisite. Without it, the cursor is slow to respond or just does its own thing. I've never seen a mouse with the jitters before, but this one will cause the cursor to jiggle and twitch, even though the mouse itself it perfectly still, untouched. I've watched the cursor jitter clear off the screen. However, using a solid black mouse pad seems to have dealt with the problem. I would send it back and try a different product, but I've sent so many cheaply made and/or mislabeled mice back to Amazon in the past month, I've got return fatigue. We'll give this one a chance with the mousepad solution.",

This mouse will only function appropriately for about 4-5 minutes tops if not directly plugged in to USB , otherwise it starts jumping/skipping/lagging etc. Plugged in it's perfect though - so if you get lucky and get one that holds a charge you'll probably be very happy with it. I just decided to keep this one and keep it plugged in. It's not ideal but it gets the job done.<br />I should probably mention that it is very easy to set up, basically plug and play - which was nice.",

I tried on my desktop protective cover (a softer plastic) and it was even worse.  Putting the mouse on paper made it move the mouse pointer faster and smoother but occasionally had hiccups.  This is unacceptable for gaming, let alone basic office work.  This wasn't even the worse part of this mouse.<br /><br />The mouse buttons require you to click on the very edge of the button to recognize the click.  Because my finger tips reach about 75% of the length I would have to click 3+ times to get Windows 11 to recognize I clicked the button.

Anyone else have this problem?! Anyway... this Seenda connects directly with Bluetooth, and connects instantly. If it sleeps (after a few hours?) it wakes and re-connects with one click, in less than a second. I charged the battery when I bought it a few weeks ago, and forgot that I might need to charge it again one day. Still going. Downsides: it is much smaller and lighter than I am used to (the M310 is easily twice as thick/tall) so I am getting used to that. Took awhile to find the right DPI/resolution/speed (and the button to change that is in a precarious, easy-to-hit-by-mistake position. Overall a great recommend.",

        "text": "I wanted a cool looking mouse to replace a Microsoft mouse that was starting to act funny, after 5 + years. After using it for an hour now I really wish I would have spent more for functionality rather than aesthetic value.<br /><br />First of all I had to pull out a sheet of paper to use as a mouse pad because my old Microsoft mouse functioned with any surface that I used it on, performed flawlessly. This new mouse can't even be used on a standard wooden desk without skipping and jumping all over the screen.<br /><br />I prepared myself mentally for a cheap feeling mouse because in the end you get what you pay for but holy cow this mouse feels like something I would buy at the local dollar store it screams lack of quality.<br /><br />I am sure I will be buying another mouse to replace this one shortly either from frustration or because it was built at such a low quality standard.",
