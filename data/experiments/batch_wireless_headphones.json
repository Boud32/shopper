I just ordered the ear pads only, and ended up using the spare two fake leather head pads that came with my G35 headset.<br />- Other thoughts: Not sure what some people are complaining about, but my ear pads are comfortable and fit my headset well. I\u2019m just going to assume some peoples ears are extremely sensitive than others to certain fabrics. I like the cloth mesh pads compared to the original leather pads for two reasons. The cloth won\u2019t crack or peel off like the leather pads, and the cloth pads are more breathable for the ears (ears won\u2019t get hot or humid).",
