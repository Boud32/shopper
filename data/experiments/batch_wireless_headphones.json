        "text": "First, my purpose is to stream audio to wired QC headphones from my AV receiver, as a replacement for my broken analog FM TV sound transmitter/phones.  For THIS purpose... I bought a pair of these BT devices, and it works, but the sync between audio and video is - versus analog - perceptible.  The streaming generation is less sensitive to this, but AV-philes find it annoying.<br /><br />It is a problem in all BT, compressed audio, technologies - to some degree. Compressed audio requires buffering, buffering introduces some minimum delay, and the delay can be worse depending upon the nature of the audio.<br />For many programs (sports, etc) sync isn't a problem, but in close-up talky-talky scenes the audio lag is annoying vs. the FM phones, which have imperceptible lag.  For NON-SYNCed applications - this is a non-issue.<br />I wish Roku had a AV sync setting (+/- ms).  This is what BT 5.0 does - it delays the video based on the estimated audio lag. *But that doesn't help here because these devices do NOT control the video stream*.<br /><br />Otherwise, audio quality of BT vs FM is equivalent. My FM phones were very good (AR, $150) and audio was excellent, so the BT pair has good sound in this application.  I have not noted any static others reported, except for a slight hum when the RX is not connected.  Generally, the BT audio is equivalent to any other BT audio connection (ie., streaming iPhone to car stereo, etc.).<br />8/18/2020 Revision:  After a power outage, I noticed a VERY bad hum.  Removed RX side's power, no change.  Removed TX sides power (from USB outlet on cable box), NO HUM.  I tried several other USB outlets, each had some hum though with different qualities.  Finally, I got out a good high amp USB hub & used it to power the TX side - no hum at all.  SO... the transmitting side is VERY sensitive to ripple in its USB power circuitry.<br /><br />One VERY annoying thing - my devices both power off after 4hrs (6hrs?)  regardless of input, even though both TX/RX devices are permanently wired to USB power. It ought to power down only if on battery or unconnected for some time (firmware update perhaps?).  Other than this obvious design choice, I have had no connection issues - power on TX, then RX, connects reliably in ~10s.  Once connected stays reliably connected UNTIL it powers down.<br /><br />So the good:  Cheap solution to use superior wired headphones.  Small & USB powered, so hides away easily on both TX and RX sides.  Cheaper & more versatile than quality FM TV transmitter/phone combos.<br /><br />And the bad:  Audio LAGS behind video noticeably, 50-150ms.  Also, I haven't tried with multiple BT sources - but there is no UI, no way to select a specific source - I suspect this would be a problem for some.<br /><br />Overall:  For the price, I can't complain and wouldn't spend 5x for good FM TV audio phones.",

That will create better sound insulation. The memory foam is about 11mm high, the largest diameter is about 12mm, and the inner diameter of the catheter is about 3mm.Made of high-quality, environmentally friendly and non-toxic materials, it has the advantages of softer, slower rebound and more durable. Memory foam is characterized by a slow rebound effect, which can change its own shape with external pressure. From the perspective of earplugs, the ear canal varies from person to person, and the memory foam will change their shape according to the individual's ear canal, making them fit the ear canal best, thus achieving more than ordinary eartips cover good wearing comfort, better noise reduction effect, bring better listening experience. Applicable to the following earplugs: SE series:  SE110/SE112/SE115/SE210/SE215/SE310/SE315/SE420/SE425/SE530/SE535/SE846 E3C/E4C/E5C/E3G/E4G/E500/i3C/i4C/ SC series: SCL3/SCL4/SCL5/",

        "text": "With the onset of Pandora, satellite radio and many other such options, I found I wasn\u2019t playing my CDs anymore.  In fact, I couldn\u2019t find my CD player!  And the high-end system in my truck doesn\u2019t even have a CD option.  So when I saw this I figured I give it a try.  I like that it\u2019s portable and plays without skipping even when bumped, running with it, or the dog knocking it off of the table.  It can be used with my several different sets of earphones.  It also plugs into my truck stereo without a problem.<br /><br />I also wanted it to play through its own speaker while in my crafts room.  This is where the 5th star gets removed.  When turning it up nearly all the way the speaker starts to buzz on certain notes.  It isn\u2019t loud at all on its own either so using it without auxiliary speakers is not good if more than about 8 feet from it.  However, I am playing my CDs which I have not heard in years, and that makes me very happy.",

        "text": "First I like sound! I'm an audiophile at heart but in my life now I'm an audiophile on a BUDGET! These are my first bluetooth speakers. More on that in a minute.<br /><br />I was looking for on ear bluetooth speakers with a budget of about $50 to $60 and was set on waiting for a sale on the JBL EB45T but then saw these recommended on the wirecutter website (a pretty good review site in my opinion)<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with these, but nothing really right about them either. They have a nice neutral sound that you can listen to for a long time. For movies and youtube on my computer, they are great. But there is nothing in the sound that is going to wow you either. Trust me if there was something actually wrong with the sound, I'd be telling you. You can listen to these for a long time without ear fatigue. If you are looking for lots of rumble for movies, these probably aren't the right phones for you. But if your movie listening requirements are more modest then these work well for that. For casual background music, podcasts, audiobooks, they will work really well for that.<br /><br />Isolation is not great. I think the plastic is thin so a certain amount of noise gets in. I wanted to be able to hear a little bit of background noise, things going on in the house, but these push my limit for how much I want to hear. Even though they were open-back my Sennheiser HD-229 did a better job with isolation because of the design of the pad.<br /><br />Comfort isn't bad and for my ears, the ear cup size is just about right size. I wish the earpieces swiveled a bit more but for my head, they swivel just enough. . They have a left and right and the cups swivel so little that if you have them on the wrong way you will notice.<br /><br />Bluetooth... These are a pain in the backside on Win 7. When I want to use them I have to go and delete the previous pairing, pair them again and then go to the control panel and set these to be used for output. For movies on the computer, they get out of sync. I even set my movie player (Pot Player which I highly recommend) to use the Bluetooth headphones and they still get out of sync with the audio. I don't know if it's the player, the USB Bluetooth adapter, Windows 7 or some combination of them together.<br /><br />I like that they can be used with a wire as well as with bluetooth. The controls are a little small, as mentioned by others but I don't have trouble working them.<br /><br />I also tried the JBL EB45T Bluetooth headphones, which cost almost twice as much, at Target and these sound better overall. The JBL might have had better highs, a little punchier bass but these are more cohesive across the frequency range with nothing tweaked to make them sound 'better'.<br /><br />Summary: I don't have any other Bluetooth headphones to compare these to but I think most people would be very satisfied with these at this price point for general use. If however, you are looking for audiophile on a budget, it's not here.",

I've just been using them at my desk and walking around town, medium use for about 5 weeks, when I noticed it was splitting.",

I have a pair of motorola solo wireless and those are much better as it pertains to battery life, sound, and durability.  These seem like they are going to break very easily.  They feel extremely cheap.  The sound is not bad but nothing overly impressive.  Battery life is meh, it's giving low battery warnings at 50% levels based on what is reported to my iPhone, Plays that warning message about every 5 minutes or so... stupid.  When I turn it on it takes a bit for it to function with my iPhone 7, Motorola solo pretty much instantly ready.  On a positive note, I've used them with phone calls and no one complains... my Motorola solo there are a few times where people had issues hearing me.",
